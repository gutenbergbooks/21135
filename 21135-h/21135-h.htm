<h3>Chapter One.</h3>
<h4>Esau Tankardew.</h4>
<p>Certainly, Mr Tankardew was not a pattern of cleanliness,
either in his house or his person. Someone had said of him
sarcastically, &ldquo;that there was nothing clean in his house
but his <i>towels</i>;&rdquo; and there was a great deal of truth
in the remark. He seemed to dwell in an element of cobwebs; the
atmosphere in which he lived, rather than breathed, was
apparently a mixture of fog and dust. Everything he had on was
faded&mdash;everything that he had about him was faded&mdash;the
only dew that seemed to visit the jaded-looking shrubs in the
approach to his dwelling was <i>mil</i>dew. Dilapidation and
dinginess went hand-in-hand everywhere: the railings round the
house were dilapidated&mdash;some had lost there points, others
came to an abrupt conclusion a few inches above the stone-work
from which they sprang; the steps were dilapidated&mdash;one of
them rocked as you set your foot upon it, and the others sloped
inwards so as to hold treacherous puddles in wet weather to
entrap unwary visitors; the entrance hall was dilapidated; if
ever there had been a pattern to the paper, it had now retired
out of sight and given place to irregular stains, which looked
something like a vast map of a desolate country, all moors and
swamps; the doors were dilapidated, fitting so badly, that when
the front door opened a sympathetic clatter of all the lesser
ones rang through the house; the floors were dilapidated, and
afforded ample convenience for easy egress and ingress to the
flourishing colonies of rats and mice which had established
themselves on the premises; and above all, Mr Tankardew himself
was dilapidated in his dress, and in his whole appearance and
habits&mdash;his very voice was dilapidated, and his words
slipshod and slovenly.</p>
<p>And yet Mr Tankardew was a man of education and a gentleman,
and you knew it before you had been five minutes in his company.
He was the owner of the house he lived in, on the outskirts of
the small town of Hopeworth, and also of considerable property in
the neighbourhood. Amongst other possessions, he was the landlord
of two houses of some pretensions, a little out in the country,
which were prettily situated in the midst of shrubberies and
orchards. In one of these houses lived a Mr Rothwell, a gentleman
of independent means; in the other a Mrs Franklin, the widow of
an officer, with her daughter Mary, now about fifteen years of
age.</p>
<p>Mr Tankardew had settled in his present residence some ten
years since. <i>Why</i> he bought it nobody knew, nor was likely
to know; all that people were sure of was that he <i>had</i>
bought it, and pretty cheap too, for it was not a house likely to
attract any one who appreciated comfort or liveliness; moreover,
current report said that it was haunted. Still, it was for sale,
and it passed somehow or other into Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s hands,
and Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s hands and whole person passed into
<i>it</i>; and here he was now with his one old servant, Molly
Gilders, a shade more dingy and dilapidated than himself. Several
persons put questions to Molly about her master, but found it a
very discouraging business, so they gave up the attempt as
hopeless, and it remained an unexplained mystery why Mr Tankardew
came to Hopeworth, and where he came from. As for questioning the
old gentleman himself, no one had the hardihood to undertake it;
and indeed he gave them little opportunity, as he very rarely
showed his face out of his own door; so rumour had to say what it
pleased, and among other things, rumour said that the old
dressing-gown in which he was ordinarily seen was never off duty,
either day or night.</p>
<p>Mr Tankardew employed no agent, but collected his own rents;
which he required to be paid to himself half-yearly, in the
beginning of January and July, at his own residence.</p>
<p>It was on one crisp, frosty, cheery January morning that Mr
Rothwell, and his son Mark, a young lad of eighteen, were ushered
into Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s sitting-room; if that could be properly
called a sitting-room, in which nobody seemed ever to sit, to
judge by the deep unruffled coating of dust which reposed on
every article, the chairs included. Respect for their own
garments caused father and son to stand while they waited for
their landlord; but, before he made his appearance, two more
visitors were introduced, or rather let into the room by old
Molly, who, considering her duty done when she had given them an
entrance into the apartment, never troubled herself as to their
further comfort and accommodation.</p>
<p>A strange contrast were these visitors to the old room and its
furniture. Mr Rothwell was a tall and rather portly man with a
pleasant countenance, a little flushed, indicating a somewhat
free indulgence in what is certainly miscalled &ldquo;good
living.&rdquo; The cast of his features was that of a person
easy-going, good-tempered, and happy; but a line or two of care
here and there, and an occasional wrinkling up of the forehead
showed that the surface was not to be trusted. Mark, his son, was
like him, and the very picture of good humour and
light-heartedness; so buoyant, indeed, that at times he seemed
indebted to spirits something more than &ldquo;animal.&rdquo; But
the brightness had not yet had any of the gilding rubbed
off&mdash;everyone liked him, no one could be dull where he was.
Mrs Franklin, how sweet and lovable her gentle face! You could
tell that, whatever she might have lost, she had gained
grace&mdash;a glow from the Better Land gave her a heavenly
cheerfulness. And Mary&mdash;she had all her mother&rsquo;s
sweetness without the shadow from past sorrows, and her laugh was
as bright and joyous as the sunlit ripple on a lake in summer
time.</p>
<p>The Rothwells and Franklins, as old friends, exchanged a
hearty but whispered greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t speak out loud,&rdquo; said Mark to
Mary, &ldquo;for fear of raising the dust, for that&rsquo;ll set
me sneezing, and then good-bye to one another; for the first
sneeze &rsquo;ll raise such a cloud that we shall never see each
other till we get out of doors again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mark, don&rsquo;t be foolish! You&rsquo;ll make me
laugh, and we shall offend poor Mr Tankardew; but it is very odd.
I never was here before, but mamma wished me to come with her, as
a sort of protection, for she&rsquo;s half afraid of the old
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your first visit to our landlord, I think?&rdquo; said
Mr Rothwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs Franklin. &ldquo;I sent my last
half-year&rsquo;s rent by Thomas, but as there are some little
alterations I want doing at the house, and Mr Tankardew,
I&rsquo;m told, will never listen to anything on this subject
second-hand, I have come myself and brought Mary with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just exactly my own case,&rdquo; said Mr Rothwell;
&ldquo;and Mark has given me his company, just for the sake of
the walk. I think you have never met our landlord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never!&mdash;and I must confess that I feel
considerably relieved that our interview will be less private
than I had anticipated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mr
Tankardew himself. He was tall and very grey, with
strongly-marked features, and deeply-furrowed cheeks and
forehead. His eyes were piercing and restless, but there was a
strange gentleness of expression about the mouth, which might
lead one, when viewing his countenance as a whole, to gather that
he was one who, though often deceived, <i>must</i> still trust
and love. He had on slippers and worsted stockings, but neither
of them were pairs. He wore an old black handkerchief with the
tie half-way towards the back of his neck, while a very long and
discoloured dressing-gown happily shrouded from view a
considerable portion of his lower raiment.</p>
<p>The room in which he met his tenants was thoroughly in keeping
with its owner: old and dignified, panelled in dark wood, with a
curiously-carved chimneypiece, and a ceiling apparently adorned
with some historical or allegorical painting, if you could only
have seen it.</p>
<p>How Mr Tankardew got into the room on the present occasion was
by no means clear, for nobody saw him enter.</p>
<p>Mark suggested to Mary, in a whisper, that he had come up
through a trap door. At any rate he was there, and greeted his
visitors without embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;sorry to see you standing. Ah! Dusty, I see;&rdquo; and
with the long tail of his dressing-gown he proceeded to raise a
cloud of dust from four massive oak chairs, much to the
disturbance of Mark&rsquo;s equanimity, who succeeded with some
difficulty in maintaining his gravity. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; added
Mr Tankardew, &ldquo;to appear in this <i>dishabille</i>, must
excuse and take me as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; replied both his
tenants, and then proceeded to business.</p>
<p>The rent had been paid and receipts duly given, when the old
man raised his eyes and fixed them on Mary&rsquo;s face. She had
been sitting back in the deep recess of a window, terribly afraid
of a mirthful explosion from Mark, and therefore drawing herself
as far out of sight as possible; but now a bright ray of sunshine
cast itself full on her sweet, loving features, and as Mr
Tankardew caught their expression he uttered a sudden
exclamation, and stood for a moment as if transfixed to the spot.
Mary felt and looked half-confused, half-frightened, but the next
moment Mr Tankardew turned away, muttered something to himself,
and then entered into the subject of requested alterations. His
visitors had anticipated some probable difficulties, if not a
refusal, on the part of their landlord; but to their surprise and
satisfaction he promised at once to do all that they required:
indeed he hardly seemed to take the matter in thoroughly, but to
have his mind occupied with something quite foreign to the
subject in hand. At last he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, get it all done&mdash;get it all done, Mr
Rothwell, Mrs Franklin&mdash;get it all done, and send in the
bills to me&mdash;there, there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he fixed his eyes earnestly on Mary&rsquo;s face, then
slowly withdrew <img src="images/nlost015.jpg" alt="" /> them,
and striding up to the fireplace opened a panel above it, and
disclosed an exquisite portrait of a young girl about
Mary&rsquo;s age. Nothing could be more striking than the
contrast between the gloomy, dingy hue of the apartment, and the
vivid colouring of the picture, which beamed out upon them like a
rainbow spanning a storm-cloud. Then he closed the panel
abruptly, and turned towards the company with a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Well, well,&rdquo; he said, half aloud;
&ldquo;well, good-morning, good-morning; when shall we meet
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words were addressed to Mrs Franklin and her
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; replied the former, hardly knowing what
to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Rothwell came to the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, I&rsquo;m sure I shall be very glad to see
you at my house; you don&rsquo;t go into society much;
it&rsquo;ll do you good to come out a little; you&rsquo;ll get
rid of a few of the cobwebs&mdash;from your mind&rdquo;&mdash;he
added hastily, becoming painfully conscious that he was treading
on rather tender ground when he was talking about cobwebs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t Mr Tankardew like to come to our
juvenile party on Twelfth Night?&rdquo; asked Mark with a little
dash of mischief in his voice, and a demure look at Mary.</p>
<p>Mrs Franklin bit her lips, and Mr Rothwell frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A juvenile party at your house?&rdquo; asked Mr
Tankardew, very gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only my son&rsquo;s nonsense, you must pardon
him,&rdquo; said Mr Rothwell; &ldquo;we always have a young
people&rsquo;s party that night, of course you would be heartily
welcome, only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A juvenile party?&rdquo; asked Mr Tankardew again, very
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Mark, for the sake of saying
something, and feeling a little bit of a culprit; &ldquo;twelfth
cake, crackers, negus, lots of fun, something like a breaking-up
at school. Miss Franklin will be there, and plenty more young
people too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like a breaking-up,&rdquo; muttered the old
man, &ldquo;more like a breaking-<i>down</i>, I should
think&mdash;I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effect of this announcement was perfectly overwhelming. Mr
Rothwell expressed his gratification with as much self-possession
as he could command, and named the hour. Mrs Franklin checked an
exclamation of astonishment with some difficulty. Poor Mary
coughed her suppressed laughter into her handkerchief; but as for
Mark, he was forced to beat a hasty retreat, and dashed down the
stairs like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>The way home lay first down a narrow lane, into which they
entered about a hundred yards from Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s house.
Here the rest of the party found Mark behaving himself rather
like a recently-escaped lunatic: he was jumping up and down, then
tossing his cap into the air, then leaning back on the bank,
holding his sides, and every now and then crying out while the
tears rolled over his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! Oh dear! What <i>shall</i> I do? Old
Tanky&rsquo;s coming to our juvenile party.&rdquo;</p>
<hr /></div>
<div class="bodytext"><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>
<h3>Chapter Two.</h3>
<h4>The Juvenile Party.</h4>
<p>Let us look into two very different houses on the morning of
January 6th.</p>
<p>Mr Rothwell&rsquo;s place is called &ldquo;The Firs,&rdquo;
from a belt of those trees which shelter the premises on the
north.</p>
<p>All is activity at &ldquo;The Firs&rdquo; on Twelfth-day
morning.</p>
<p>It is just noon, and Mrs Rothwell and her daughters are
assembled in the drawing-room making elaborate preparations for
the evening with holly, and artificial flowers and mottoes, and
various cunning and beautiful devices. On a little table by the
grand piano stands a tray with a decanter of sherry, a glass jug
filled (and likely to remain so) with water, and a few biscuits.
Mrs Rothwell is lying back in an elegant easy-chair, looking
flushed and languid. Her three daughters, Jane, Florence, and
Alice, are standing near her, all looking rather weary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a bore these parties are!&rdquo; exclaimed the
eldest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick to death of them. I shall be tired
out before the evening begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So shall I,&rdquo; chimes in her sister Florence.
&ldquo;I hate having to be civil to those odious little frights,
the Graysons, and their cousins. Why can&rsquo;t they stay at
home and knock one another&rsquo;s heads about in the
nursery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very aimiable of you I must say, my dears,&rdquo;
drawls out Mrs Rothwell. &ldquo;Come, you must exert yourselves,
you know it only comes once a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, once too often, mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; cries little Alice, &ldquo;I
shall enjoy the party very much: it&rsquo;ll be jolly, as Mark
says, only I wish I wasn&rsquo;t so tired just now: ah! Dear
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Child, don&rsquo;t yawn!&rdquo; says her mother;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll make me more fatigued than I am, and
I&rsquo;m quite sinking now. Jane, do just pour me out another
glass of sherry. Thank you, I can sip a little as I want it. Take
some yourself, my dear, it&rsquo;ll do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me too, mamma,&rdquo; cries Alice, stretching out
her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Alice, you&rsquo;re too young; you
mustn&rsquo;t be getting into wanting wine so early in the day,
it&rsquo;ll spoil your digestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Nonsense, mamma! Everybody takes it now;
it&rsquo;ll do me good, you&rsquo;ll see. Mark often gives me
wine; he&rsquo;s a dear good brother is Mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Rothwell sighs, and takes a sip of sherry: she is
beginning to brighten up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world did your father mean by asking old Mr
Tankardew to the party to-night?&rdquo; she exclaims, turning to
her elder daughters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean! Mamma&mdash;you may well ask that: the old
scarecrow! They say he looks like a bag of dust and
rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark says,&rdquo; cries her sister, &ldquo;that
he&rsquo;s just the image of a stuffed Guy Fawkes, which the boys
used to carry about London on a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dears, we must make the best of matters, we
can&rsquo;t help it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I daresay it&rsquo;ll be capital fun,&rdquo;
exclaims Alice; &ldquo;I shall like to see Mark doing the polite
to &lsquo;Old Tanky,&rsquo; as he calls him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Miss Pert, you must mind your behaviour,&rdquo;
says Florence; &ldquo;remember, Mr Tankardew is a gentleman and
an old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Miss Gravity, but I&rsquo;m not going to learn
manners of you; mamma pays Miss Craven to teach me that, so
good-bye;&rdquo; and the child, with a mocking courtesy towards
her sister, runs out of the room laughing.</p>
<p>And now let us look into the breakfast-room of &ldquo;The
Shrubbery,&rdquo; as Mrs Franklin&rsquo;s house is called.</p>
<p>Mary and her mother are sitting together, the former adding
some little adornments to her evening dress, and the latter
knitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like Mark Rothwell, mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mamma! What a cruelly direct answer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I speak the direct truth,
Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes, certainly the truth, only you might have
softened it off a little, because I think you must like some
things in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is cheerful and good-tempered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And obliging, mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that, Mary; self-indulgent
people are commonly selfish people, and selfish people are seldom
obliging: a really obliging person is one who will cross his own
inclination to gratify yours, without having any selfish end in
view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t think Mark would do this,
mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost think not. I like to see a person obliging
from principle, and not merely from impulse: not merely when his
being obliging is only another form of
self-gratification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should not Mark Rothwell be obliging on
principle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mary, you know my views. I can trust a person as
truly obliging who acts on Christian principle, who follows the
rule, &lsquo;Look not everyone on his own things, but everyone
also on the things of others,&rsquo; because he loves Christ. I
am afraid poor Mark has never learned to love Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary sighs, and her mother looks anxiously at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest child,&rdquo; she says, earnestly, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want you to get too intimate with the young
Rothwells. I am sure they are not such companions as your own
heart would approve of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, mamma, I can&rsquo;t say I admire the way in
which they have been brought up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admire it! Oh! Mary, this is one of the crying sins of
the day. I mean the utter selfishness and self-indulgence in
which so many young people are educated; they must eat, they must
drink, they must talk just like their elders; they acknowledge no
betters, they spurn all authority; the holy rule,
&lsquo;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is
right,&rsquo; is quite out of date with too many of them
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear it is so, mamma. I don&rsquo;t like the girls
much at &lsquo;The Firs,&rsquo; but I cannot help liking Mark; I
mean,&rdquo; she added, colouring, &ldquo;as a light-hearted,
generous, pleasant boy.&rdquo; A silence of a few moments, and
then she looks up and says, timidly and lovingly, &ldquo;If you
think it better, dearest mamma, I won&rsquo;t go to the party
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mary, I would not advise that; <i>I</i> shall be
with you, and I should like you to see and judge for yourself. I
have every confidence in you. I do believe that you love your
Saviour, and loving Him, I feel sure that you will not knowingly
enter into any very intimate acquaintance with any one who has
not the same hope; without which hope, my precious child, there
may be much amiability and attractiveness, but can be no solid
and abiding happiness or peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s reply is a child&rsquo;s earnest embrace and a
whispered assurance of unchanging love to her mother, and trust
in her judgment.</p>
<p>Six o&rsquo;clock.&mdash;Both drawing-rooms at &ldquo;The
Firs&rdquo; were thrown into one, and brilliantly lighted up.
Mysterious sounds in the dining-room below told of preparations
for that part of the evening&rsquo;s proceedings, by no means the
least gratifying to the members of a juvenile party. Friends
began to assemble: young boys and girls in shoals, the former
dazzling in neckties and pins, the latter in brooches and
earrings: with a sprinkling of seniors. The host, hostess, and
her daughters were all smiles; the last-named especially, unable,
indeed, to give expression to their satisfaction at having the
happiness of receiving their dear young friends. Mark was there,
of course, full of fun, and really enjoying himself, the life and
soul of everything.</p>
<p>And now, when Mrs Franklin and Mary had just taken their seats
and had begun to look around them, the door was thrown widely
open, and the servant announced in a loud voice, &ldquo;Mr Esau
Tankardew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every sound was instantly hushed, every head bent forward,
every mouth parted in breathless expectation. Mark crept close up
to Mary and squeezed his white gloves into ropes; the next moment
Mr Tankardew entered.</p>
<p>Marvellous transformation! The faded garments had entirely
disappeared. Was this the man of dilapidation? Yes, it was Mr
Tankardew. He was habited in a suit of black, which, though not
new, had evidently not seen much service; his trousers ceased at
the knee, leaving his silk stockings and shoes conspicuous. No
reproach could be cast on the purity of his white neckcloth, nor
on the general cleanliness of his person. His greeting of the
host and hostess, though a little old-fashioned, was thoroughly
easy and courteous, after which he begged them to leave him to
himself, and to give their undivided attention to the young,
whose special evening it was. Curiosity once gratified, the
suspended buzz of eager talk broke out again, and allowed Mr
Tankardew to make his way to Mrs Franklin and her daughter. These
he saluted very heartily, and added, &ldquo;Let an old man sit by
you awhile, and watch the proceedings of the young people, and
realise if he possibly can that he was once young
himself&mdash;ah yes! Once young,&rdquo; and he sighed
deeply.</p>
<p>Fun and frolic were soon at their height. Merry music struck
up, and the larger of the two drawing-rooms was cleared for a
dance. Mark hurried up to Mary. &ldquo;Come, Mary,&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;I want you for a partner; we shall have capital
fun; come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I prefer to watch
the others&mdash;at present, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Nonsense! You <i>must</i> come, there&rsquo;ll be
no fun without you; it&rsquo;s very hot though, but
there&rsquo;ll be lots of negus presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary will do her part by trying to amuse some of the
very little ones,&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;I think that
will be more to her taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes, dear mamma, that it will. Thank you, Mark, all
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, very good, very good,&rdquo; cried Mr Tankardew,
in a low voice, and beating one hand gently on the other;
&ldquo;keep to that, my child, keep to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark retired with a very bad grace, and Mary, slipping away
from her mother&rsquo;s side, gathered a company around her of
the tinier sort, with glowing cheeks and very wide eyes, who were
rather scared by the more boisterous proceedings of those
somewhat older; she amused them in a quiet way, raising many a
little happy laugh, and fairly winning their hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless her,&rdquo; muttered Mr Tankardew, when he
had watched her for some time very attentively; &ldquo;very good,
that will do, very good indeed; keep her to it, Mrs Franklin,
keep her to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear, good child,&rdquo; said her
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true, madam; yes, dear and good; some are dear and
bad&mdash;dear at any price. I see some now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wine and negus were soon handed round; the tray was presented
to Mary. Mr Tankardew lent forward and bent a piercing look at
her. She declined, not at all knowing that he was watching
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good again; very good, good girl, wise girl, prudent
girl,&rdquo; he murmured to himself.</p>
<p>The tray now came to Mrs Franklin. She took a glass of sherry.
Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s brow clouded. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, and moved restlessly on his chair. The servant then
approached him and offered the contents of the tray, but he waved
it off with an imperious gesture of his hand, and did not
vouchsafe a word.</p>
<p>The more boisterous party in the other room now became
conscious of the presence of the wine and negus, and rushed in,
surrounding the maid who was bringing in a fresh supply. Mark was
at the head of them, and tossed down two glasses in rapid
succession. The rest clamoured for the strong drink with eager
hands and outstretched arms. &ldquo;Give me some, give me
some,&rdquo; was uttered on all sides. Self reigned
paramount.</p>
<p>Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s tall form rose high above the edge of the
struggling crowd, which he had approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor things, poor things, poor things!&rdquo; he said
gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pleasant sight, these little ones enjoying
themselves,&rdquo; said Mr Rothwell, coming up.</p>
<p>Mr Tankardew seemed scarcely to hear him, and returned to his
place by Mrs Franklin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enjoying themselves!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in an
undertone, &ldquo;call it pampering the flesh, killing the soul,
and courting the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather hard upon the poor dear children,&rdquo;
laughingly remarked a lady, who overheard him: &ldquo;why, surely
you wouldn&rsquo;t deny <i>them</i>, their share of the enjoyment
of God&rsquo;s good creatures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s good creatures, madam! Are the wine and
negus God&rsquo;s good creatures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly they are,&rdquo; was the reply: &ldquo;God
has permitted man to manufacture them out of the fruits of the
earth, and to make them the means of pleasurable excitement, and
therefore surely we may take them and give them as His good
creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Tankardew made no answer, but striding up to Mary, where
she sat with a circle of little interesting faces round her,
eagerly intent on some simple story she was telling them, he
said, &ldquo;Miss Franklin, will you favour me by bringing me a
few of your young friends here. There, now, my dear,&rdquo;
(speaking to one of the little girls), &ldquo;just hand me that
empty negus glass.&rdquo; The child did so, and Mr Tankardew,
producing from his coat pocket a considerable sized bottle,
turned to the lady who had addressed him, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, will you help me to dispense some of the
contents of this bottle to these little children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I suppose it is
something very good, such as little folks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is one of God&rsquo;s good creatures, madam:&rdquo;
saying which, he turned <img src="images/nlost029.jpg" alt="" />
towards the other&rsquo;s astonished gaze the broad label on
which was printed in great black letters,
&ldquo;Laudanum&mdash;Poison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, madam, that the liquid in this bottle is made
from the poppy, which is one of the fruits of the earth;
therefore it is one of God&rsquo;s good creatures, just as the
wine and negus are. It produces very pleasurable sensations, too,
if you take it, just as <i>they</i> do; therefore it is right to
indulge in it, and give it to others, just as it is right for the
same reasons to indulge in wine and negus and spirits, and to
give them to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t understand you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, madam? I think you won&rsquo;t be able
to pick a hole in my argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! But this liquid is poison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is alcohol, madam, only it is not labelled so:
more&rsquo;s the pity, for it has killed thousands and tens of
thousands, where laudanum has only killed units. There, my
child,&rdquo; he added, turning to Mary, and taking an elegant
little packet from his pocket, &ldquo;give these <i>bonbons</i>
to the little ones. I didn&rsquo;t mean to disappoint
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this dialogue was going on, the rest of the party was
too full of noisy mirth to notice what was passing. Mark&rsquo;s
voice was getting very wild and conspicuous; and now he made his
way with flushed face and sparkling eyes to Mary, who was sitting
quietly between her mother and Mr Tankardew. He carried a jug in
one hand, and a glass in the other, and, without noticing the
elder people, exclaimed, &ldquo;It is an hour yet to supper time,
and you&rsquo;ll be dead with thirst; I am sure I am. You must
take some of this, it is capital stuff; our butler made it: I
have just had a tumbler&mdash;it is punch. Come, Mary, you
must,&rdquo; and he thrust the glass into her hand: &ldquo;you
must, I say; you shall; never mind old Tanky,&rdquo; he added, in
what he meant to be a whisper. Then he raised the jug with
unsteady fingers, but, before a drop could reach the tumbler, Mr
Tankardew had risen, and with one sweep of his hand dashed it out
of Mary&rsquo;s grasp on the ground. Few heard the crash, amidst
the din of the general merriment, and those who noticed it
supposed it to be an accident. &ldquo;Nearly lost!&rdquo;
whispered Mr Tankardew in Mary&rsquo;s ear; then he said, in a
louder voice, &ldquo;Faugh! The atmosphere of this place does not
suit me. I must retire. Mrs Franklin, pray make an old
man&rsquo;s excuses to our host and hostess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was <i>gone</i>!</p>

<h3>Chapter Three.</h3>
<h4>The Swollen Stream.</h4>
<p>It is the morning after the juvenile party at &ldquo;The
Firs.&rdquo; A clear, bright frost still: everything
<i>outside</i> the house fresh and vigorous: half-a-dozen
labourers&rsquo; little children running to school with faces
like peonies; jumping, racing, sliding, puffing out clouds of
steaming breath as they shout out again and again for very excess
of health and spirits.</p>
<p>Everything <i>inside</i> the house limp, languid, and
lugubrious; the fires are sulky and won&rsquo;t burn; the maids
are sulkier still. Mr Rothwell breakfasts alone, feeling warm in
nothing but his temper: the grate sends forth little white jets
of smoke from a wall of black coal, instead of presenting a
cheery surface of glowing heat: the toast is black at the corners
and white in the middle: the eggs look so truly new laid that
they seem to have come at once from the henhouse to the table,
without passing through the saucepan: the coffee is feeble and
the milk smoked: the news in the daily papers is flat, and the
state of affairs in country and county peculiarly depressing.
Upstairs, Mrs Rothwell tosses about with a sick headache, unable
to rest and unwilling to rise. The young ladies are dawdling in
dressing-gowns over a bedroom breakfast, and exchanging mutual
sarcasms and recriminations, blended with gall and bitterness
flung back on last night&rsquo;s party. Poor Mark has the worst
of it, nausea and splitting headache, with a shameful sense of
having made both a fool and a beast of himself. So much for the
delights of &ldquo;lots of negus, wine, and punch!&rdquo; He has
also a humbling remembrance of having been rude to Mr Tankardew.
A knock at his door. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, there&rsquo;s a hamper come for
you,&rdquo; says the butler; &ldquo;shall I bring it
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hamper is brought in and opened; it is only a small one.
In the midst of a deep bed of straw lies a hard substance; it is
taken out and the paper wrapped round it unfolded; only a glass
tumbler! There is a paper in it on which is written, &ldquo;To Mr
Mark Rothwell, from Mr Esau Tankardew, to replace what he broke
last night: keep it empty, my boy; keep it empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine o&rsquo;clock at &ldquo;The Shrubbery.&rdquo; Mary and
her mother are seated at breakfast, both a little dull and
disinclined to speak. At last Mary breaks the silence by a
profound sigh. Mrs Franklin smiles, and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem rather burdened with care, my
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, dear mamma; I don&rsquo;t
think it is exactly care, but I&rsquo;m dissatisfied or
disappointed that I don&rsquo;t feel happier for last
night&rsquo;s party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think there was much real enjoyment in
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to <i>me</i>, mamma; and I don&rsquo;t imagine very
much to anybody&mdash;except, perhaps, to some of the very little
ones. There was a hollowness and emptiness about the whole thing;
plenty of excitement and a great deal of selfishness, but nothing
to make me feel really brighter and happier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my child; I quite agree with you: and I was
specially sorry for old Mr Tankardew. I can&rsquo;t quite
understand what induced him to come: his conduct was very
strange, and yet there is something very amiable about him in the
midst of his eccentricities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a horror he seems to have of wine and negus and
suchlike things, mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I&rsquo;m sure what he saw last night would
not make him any fonder of them. Poor Mark Rothwell quite forgot
himself. I was truly glad to get away early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! So was I, mamma; it was terrible. I wish he
wouldn&rsquo;t touch such things; I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll do
himself harm if he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, Mary; harm in body, and character, and
soul. Those are fearful words, &lsquo;No drunkard shall inherit
the kingdom of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I was like Mr Tankardew,&rdquo; says Mary, after
a pause; &ldquo;did you see, mamma, how he refused the negus? I
never saw such a frown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mary, I&rsquo;m not certain that total abstinence
would suit either of us, but it is better to be on the safe side.
I am sure, in these days of special self-indulgence, it would be
worth a little sacrifice if our example might do good; but
I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a lovely morning in the September after the juvenile
party, one of those mornings which combine the glow of summer
with the richness of autumn. A picnic had been arranged to a
celebrated hill about ten miles distant from Hopeworth. The
Rothwells had been the originators, and had pressed Mary Franklin
to join the party. Mrs Franklin had at first declined for her
daughter. She increasingly dreaded any intimacy between her and
Mark, whose habits she feared were getting more and more
self-indulgent; and Mary herself was by no means anxious to go,
but Mark&rsquo;s father had been particularly pressing on the
subject, more so than Mrs Franklin could exactly understand, so
she yielded to the joint importunity of father and son, though
with much reluctance. Mary had seen Mark occasionally since the
night of the 6th of January, and still liked him, without a
thought of going beyond this; but she was grieved to see how
strongly her mother felt against him, and was inclined to think
her a little hard. True, he had been betrayed into an excess on
Twelfth night; but, then, he was no drunkard. So she argued to
herself, and so too many argue; but how strange it is that people
should argue so differently about the sin of drunkenness from
what they argue about other sins! If a man lies to us <i>now and
then</i>, do we call him <i>habitually</i> truthful? If a man
steals <i>now and then</i>, do we call him <i>habitually</i>
honest? Surely not; yet if a man is <i>only now and then</i>
drunken, his fault is winked at; he is considered by many as
<i>habitually</i> a sober man; and yet, assuredly, if there be
one sin more than another which from the guilt and misery that it
causes deserves little indulgence, it is the sin of drunkenness.
Mary took the common view, and could not think of Mark as being
otherwise than habitually sober, because he was only now and then
the worse for strong drink.</p>
<p>It was, as we have said, a lovely September morning, and all
the members of the picnic party were in high spirits. An omnibus
had been hired expressly for the occasion. Mark sat by the
driver, and acted as presiding genius. The common meeting-place
was an old oak, above a mile out of the town, and thither by ten
o&rsquo;clock all the providers and their provisions had made
their way. No one could look more bright than Mark Rothwell, no
one more peacefully lovely than Mary Franklin. All being seated,
off they started at an uproarious signal from Mark. Away they
went, along level road, through pebbly lane, its banks gorgeous
with foxgloves and fragrant with honeysuckles, over wild heath,
and then up grassy slopes. There were fourteen in the party: Mr
Rothwell, Mark and his three sisters, and a lady neighbour; Mrs
Franklin and her daughter, with a female friend; and five young
gentlemen who were or seemed to be cousins, more or less, to
everybody. Five miles were soon passed, and then the road was
crossed by a little stream. Cautiously the lumbering vehicle made
its way down the shelving gravel, plunged into the sparkling
water, fouling it with thick eddies of liquid mud, and then, with
some slight prancings on the part of the willing horses, gained
the opposite bank. The other five miles were soon accomplished,
all feeling the exhilarating effect of drinking in copious
draughts of mountain air&mdash;God&rsquo;s pure and unadulterated
stimulant to strengthen the nerves, string up the muscles, and
clear the brain, free from every drop of spirit except the
glowing spirit of health. And now the omnibus was abandoned by a
little roadside inn to the care of a hostler, who took the horses
(poor dumb brutes!) to feast on corn and water, God&rsquo;s truly
&ldquo;good creatures,&rdquo; unspoilt by the perverse hand of
self-indulgent man!</p>
<p>The driver, with the rest of the party, toiled up the
hill-side, and all, on gaining the summit, gazed with admiration
across one of those lovely scenes which may well make us feel
that the stamp of God&rsquo;s hand is there, however much man may
have marred what his Creator has made: wood and lane, cornfields
red-ripe, turnip fields in squares of dazzling green, were spread
out before them in rich embroidery with belts of silver stream
flashing like diamonds on the robe of beauty with which Almighty
love had clothed the earth. Oh! To think that sin should defile
so fair a prospect! Yet sin was there, though unseen by those
delighted gazers. Ay, and thickly sown among those sweet hills
and dales were drunkards&rsquo; houses, where hearts were
withering, and beings made for immortality were destroying body
and soul by a lingering suicide.</p>
<p>An hour passed quickly by, and there came a summons to
luncheon. Under a tall rock, affording an unbroken view of the
magnificent landscape outspread below, the tablecloth was laid
and secured at the corners by large stones. Pies both savoury and
sweet were abundant, bread sufficient, salt scanty, and water
absent altogether. Bottles were plentiful&mdash;bottles of ale,
of porter, of wines heavy and light. Corks popped, champagne
fizzed, ale sparkled. Mark surrendered the eatables into other
hands, and threw his whole energies into the joint consumption
and distribution of strong drink. He seemed in this matter, at
least, to act upon the rule that &ldquo;Example is better than
precept&rdquo;: if he pressed others to drink, he led the way by
taking copious draughts himself. The driver, too, was not
forgotten; the poor man was getting a chance of rising a little
above his daily plodding as he looked out on the lovely scenery
before him: but he was not to be left to God&rsquo;s teachings;
ale, porter, champagne, he must taste them all. Mark insisted on
it; so the unfortunate man drank and drank, and then threw
himself down among some heath to sleep off, if he could, the
fumes of alcohol that were clouding his brains.</p>
<p>And what of Mrs Franklin and Mary? Both had declined all the
stimulants, and had asked for water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; cried Mark; &ldquo;water! I&rsquo;ve
taken very good care that there shall be no water drunk to-day;
you must take some wine or ale, you must indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will manage without it, if you please,&rdquo; said
Mrs Franklin quietly.</p>
<p>Mark pressed the intoxicants upon them even to rudeness, but
without effect. Mr Rothwell was evidently annoyed at his
son&rsquo;s pertinacity, and tried to check him; but all in vain,
for Mark had taken so much as just to make him obstinate and
unmanageable. But, finding that he could not prevail, the young
man hurried away in anger, and plied the other members of the
company with redoubled vigour.</p>
<p>So engrossing had been the luncheon that few of the party had
noticed a sudden lull in the atmosphere, and an oppressive calm
which had succeeded to the brisk and cheery breeze. But now, as
Mary rose from her seat on the grass, she said to her mother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mamma, how close it has become! And look there in
the distance: what a threatening bank of clouds! I fear we are
going to have a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear so indeed, Mary; we must give our friends
warning, and seek out a shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All had now become conscious of the change. A stagnant heat
brooded over everything; not a breath of wind; huge banks of
magnificent storm-cloud came marching up majestically from the
horizon, throwing out little jets of lightning, with solemn
murmurs of thunder. Drop, drop, drop, tinkled on the gathered
leaves, now quicker, now quicker, and thicker. Under a huge roof
of overhanging rock the party cowered together. At last, down
came the storm with a blast like a hurricane, and deluges of
rain. On, on it poured relentlessly, with blinding lightning and
deafening peals of thunder. Hour after hour! Would it never
cease? At last a lull between four and five o&rsquo;clock, and,
as the tempest rolled murmuring away, the dispirited friends
began their preparations for returning. Six o&rsquo;clock before
all had reached the inn. Where were the driver and Mark? Another
tedious hour before they appeared, and each manifestly the worse
for liquor. Past seven by the time they had fairly started. And
now the clouds began to gather again. On they went, furiously at
first, and then in unsteady jerks, the omnibus swaying strangely.
It was getting dark, and the lowering clouds made it darker
still. Not a word was spoken by the passengers, but each was
secretly dreading the crossing of the stream. At last the bank
was gained&mdash;but what a change! The little brook had become a
torrent deep and strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! For goodness&rsquo; sake, stop! Stop! Let us get
out,&rdquo; screamed the Misses Rothwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In with it! In with it!&rdquo; roared Mark to the
driver; &ldquo;dash through like a trump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tchuck, tchuck,&rdquo; was the half-drunken
driver&rsquo;s reply, as he lashed his horses and urged them into
the stream.</p>
<p>Down they went: splash! Dash! Plunge! The water foaming
against the <img src="images/nlost041.jpg" alt="" /> wheels like
a millstream. Screams burst from all the terrified ladies except
Mary and her mother, who held each other&rsquo;s hand tightly.
Mrs Franklin had taught her daughter presence of mind both by
example and precept. But now the water rushed into the vehicle
itself as the frightened horses struggled for the opposite bank.
Mark&rsquo;s voice was now heard in curses, as he snatched the
whip from the driver and scourged the poor bewildered horses.
Another splash: the driver was gone: the poor animals pulled
nobly. Crash! Jerk! Bang! A trace had snapped: another jerk, a
fearful dashing and struggling, the omnibus was drawn half out of
the water, and lay partly over on its side: then all was still
except the wails and the shrieks of the ladies. Happily a lamp
had been lighted and still burned in the omnibus, which was now
above the full violence of the water. The door was opened and the
passengers released; but by whom?&mdash;certainly not by Mark. A
tall figure moved about in the dusk, and coming up to Mary threw
a large cloak over her shoulders, for it was now raining heavily,
and said in a voice whose tones she was sure she knew:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, my child, your mother is close at hand;
there, trust to me; take my other arm, Mrs Franklin: very
fortunate I was at hand to help. The drink, the drink,&rdquo; he
muttered in a low voice; &ldquo;if they&rsquo;d stuck to the
water at the beginning they wouldn&rsquo;t have stuck <i>in</i>
the water at the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now a light flashed on them: it was the ruddy glow from a
forge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in for a moment,&rdquo; said their conductor,
&ldquo;till I see what is to be done. Tom Flint, lend us a
lantern, and send your Jim to show some of these good people the
way to the inn; they&rsquo;ll get no strong drink there,&rdquo;
he said, half to himself.</p>
<p>And now several of the unlucky company had straggled into the
smithy, which was only a <i>few</i> yards from the swollen
stream. Among these was Mark, partially sobered by the accident,
and dripping from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some capital stuff to stave off a
cold,&rdquo; he said, addressing Mrs Franklin and her daughter,
whose faces were visible in the forge light: at the same time he
rilled the cover of a small flask with spirits. &ldquo;Come, let
us be as jolly as we can under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mrs Franklin; &ldquo;perhaps a
very little mixed with water might be prudent, as Mary, I fear,
is very wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark stretched out the cup towards her, but before a drop
could be taken the tall stranger had stepped forward, and
snatching it, had emptied its contents on the glowing coals. Up
there shot a brilliant dazzling flame to the smoky roof, and in
that vivid blaze Mrs Franklin and Mary both recognised in their
timely helper none other than Mr Esau Tankardew.</p>
<hr /></div>
<div class="bodytext"><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>
<h3>Chapter Four.</h3>
<h4>A Mysterious Stranger.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;This way, this way,&rdquo; said Mr Tankardew, utterly
unmoved by the expression of angry astonishment on the face of
Mark Rothwell at the sudden conversion of his cup of liquid fire
into harmless flame&mdash;&ldquo;Come this way, come this way,
Mrs and Miss Franklin: Tom, give me the lantern, I&rsquo;ll take
the ladies to Sam Hodges&rsquo; farm, and do you be so good as to
see this young gentleman across to the &lsquo;Wheatsheaf&rsquo;;
Jones will look well after them all, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he offered his arm to Mrs Franklin, and bade Mary
follow close behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be all right, madam,&rdquo; he added, seeing a
little hesitation on the part of his companion; &ldquo;you may
trust an old man to keep you out of harm&rsquo;s way: there, let
me go first with the lantern; now, two steps and you are over the
stile: the path is rather narrow, you must keep close to the
hedge: just over three fields and we shall be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a word was uttered as they followed their guide. Mrs
Franklin lifted up her heart in silent praise for their
preservation, and in prayer for present direction. Backward and
forward swayed the lantern, just revealing snatches of hedge and
miry path. At last the deep barking of a dog told that they were
not far off from a dwelling: the next minute Mr Tankardew
exclaimed, &ldquo;Here we are;&rdquo; and the light showed them
that they were come to a little gate in a paling fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollo, Sam,&rdquo; shouted out their guide: the
dog&rsquo;s barking was instantly changed into a joyful whine. A
door opened a few yards in front of them, and a dark figure
appeared in the midst of a square opening all ablaze with
cheerful light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollo, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr Tankardew again, in a more
subdued voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, mayster? All right,&rdquo; cried the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you some company, Sam, rather late
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, mayster, company and all,&rdquo;
was the reply. In a few moments all three had entered, and found
themselves in an enormous kitchen, nearly large enough to
accommodate a village. Huge beams crossed the low white ceiling;
great massive doors opened in different directions rather on the
slant through age, and giving a liberal allowance of space at top
and bottom for ventilation. A small colony of hams and flitches
hung in view; and a monstrous chimney, with a fire in the centre,
invited a nearer approach, and seemed fashioned for a cozy
retiring place from the world of kitchen. Everything looked warm
and comfortable, from the farmer, his wife and daughter, to the
two cats dozing on the hearth. Vessels of copper, brass, and tin
shone so brightly that it seemed a shame to use them for anything
but looking-glasses; while tables and chairs glowed with the
results of perpetual friction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sit ye down, sit ye down, ladies,&rdquo; said Mrs
Hodges; &ldquo;there, come into the chimney nook: eh! Deary me!
Ye&rsquo;re quite wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Betty,&rdquo; said Mr Tankardew, &ldquo;these
ladies joined a party to the hills, and, coming back,
they&rsquo;ve been nearly upset into the brook, which is running
now like a mill stream; they came in an omnibus, and very nearly
stuck fast in the middle; it is a mercy they were not all
drowned; no thanks to the driver, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor things,&rdquo; exclaimed the farmer&rsquo;s wife;
&ldquo;come, I must help you to some dry things, such as they
are: and you must stay here to-night; it is not fit for you to go
home, indeed it is not,&rdquo; she added, as Mrs Franklin
prepared to decline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you as comfortable as ever I can. Jane,
go and put a fire in the Red-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs Franklin, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
think of allowing you to put yourself to all this trouble;
besides, our servants will be alarmed when they find us not
returning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me, madam,&rdquo; said Mr Tankardew;
&ldquo;I shall sleep at the &lsquo;Wheatsheaf&rsquo; to-night,
and will take care to send a trusty messenger over to &lsquo;The
Shrubbery&rsquo; to tell them how matters stand; and Mr Hodges
will, I am sure, drive you over in his gig in the morning. Hark
how the rain comes down! You really must stop: Mrs Hodges will
make you very comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With many thanks, but still with considerable reluctance, Mrs
Franklin acquiesced in this arrangement. Their hostess then
accommodated them with such garments as they needed, and all
assembled round the blazing fire. Mr Tankardew had divested
himself of a rough top coat, and, looking like the gentleman he
was, begged Mrs Hodges to give them some tea.</p>
<p>What a tea that was! Mary, though delicately brought up,
thought she had never tasted anything like it, so delicious and
reviving: such ham! Such eggs! Such bread! Such cream! Really, it
was almost worth while getting the fright and the wetting to
enjoy such a meal with so keen a relish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a famous distillery in this
house,&rdquo; remarked Mr Tankardew when they had finished their
tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A famous what?&rdquo; asked Mrs Franklin, in great
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Mary aghast, &ldquo;I really
thought I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You thought they were teetotalers here: well, you
should know that it is a common custom in these parts to put rum
or other spirits into the tea, especially when people have
company. Now, Hodges and his wife are not content with putting
spirits into the tea, but they put them into everything: into
their bread, and their ham, and into their eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Franklin looked partly dismayed and partly puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is true, madam. The fact is simply this: the
spirits which my good tenants distil are made up of four
ingredients&mdash;diligence, good temper, honesty, and total
abstinence; and that is what makes everything they have to be so
good of its kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had more distilleries of this kind,&rdquo;
said Mrs Franklin, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, madam; but it is a sadly dishonest,
unfaithful, and self-indulgent age, and the drink has very much
to do with it, directly or indirectly. Here, Sam,&rdquo; to the
farmer and his wife who had just re-entered the kitchen,
&ldquo;do you and your mistress come and draw up your chairs, and
give us a little of your thoughts on the subject; there&rsquo;s
nothing, sometimes, so good as seeing with other people&rsquo;s
eyes, specially when they are the eyes of persons who look on
things from a different level of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mayster Tankardew,&rdquo; said the farmer,
&ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t for the likes of me to be giving my opinion
of things afore you and these ladies; but I <i>has</i> my
opinion, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you have. Now, tell us what you think about
the young people of our day, and their self-indulgent
habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Mayster! You&rsquo;re got upon a sore subject; it
is time summut was done, we&rsquo;re losing all the girls and
boys, there&rsquo;ll be none at all thirty years
hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; said Mrs Franklin
anxiously, &ldquo;that there is any unusual mortality just now
among children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, ma&rsquo;am, that&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; cried
the farmer, laughing: &ldquo;no, I mean that we shall have
nothing but babies and men and women; we shall skip the boys and
girls altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just this way, ma&rsquo;am: as soon as young
mayster and miss gets old enough to know how things is,
they&rsquo;re too old for the nursery; they won&rsquo;t go in
leading strings; they must be little men and women. Plain food
won&rsquo;t do for &rsquo;em; they must have just what their pas
and mas has. They&rsquo;ve no notion of holding their
tongues&mdash;not they; they must talk with the biggest; and I
blames their parents for it, I do. They never think of checking
them; they&rsquo;re too much like old Eli. The good old-fashioned
rod&rsquo;s gone to light the fire with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and Sam,&rdquo; broke in his wife,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s almost worst of all&mdash;and oh! It is a sin
and a shame&mdash;they let &rsquo;em get to the beer and the wine
and the spirits: you mustn&rsquo;t say them nay. Ay, it is sad,
it is for sure, to see how these little ones is brought up to
think of nothing but themselves; and then, when they goes wrong,
their fathers and mothers can&rsquo;t think how it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, wife; they dress their bodies as
they like, and eat and drink what they like, and don&rsquo;t see
how Christ bought their bodies for Himself, and they are not
their own. Ah! There&rsquo;ll be an awful reckoning one day.
Young people can&rsquo;t grow up as they&rsquo;re doing and not
leave a mark on our country as it&rsquo;ll take a big fire of the
Almighty&rsquo;s chastisements to burn it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Franklin sighed, and Mary looked very thoughtful.</p>
<p>Mr Tankardew was about to speak when a faint halloo was heard
above the noise of the storm, which was now again raging without.
All paused to listen. It was repeated again, and this time
nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody missed his road, I should think,&rdquo; said
Mr Tankardew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, sir; I&rsquo;ll go out and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, Sam Hodges left the kitchen, and calling to quiet
his dog who was barking furiously, soon returned with a stranger
who was dressed in a long waterproof and felt hat, which he
doffed on seeing the ladies, disclosing a head of curling black
hair. He was rather tall, and apparently slightly made, as far as
could be judged; for the wrappings in which he was clothed from
head to foot concealed the build of his person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to disturb you,&rdquo; he said, in a gentlemanly
voice. &ldquo;It is a terrible night, and I&rsquo;ve missed my
way. I ought to have been at Hopeworth by now, perhaps you can
kindly direct me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t
be off again to-night: we&rsquo;ll manage to take you in:
we&rsquo;ll find you a bed, and you&rsquo;re welcome to such as
we have to eat and drink: it is plain, but it is
wholesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks, kind friends,&rdquo; replied the
other; &ldquo;but I feel sure that I am intruding. These
ladies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are driven in here like yourself by the
storm,&rdquo; said Mrs Franklin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should
be the very last to wish any one to expose himself again to such
a night on our account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Tankardew had not spoken since the stranger&rsquo;s
entrance; he was sitting rather in shadow and the new-comer had
scarcely noticed him. But now the old man leant forward, and
looked at the new guest as though his whole soul was going out of
his eyes; it was but for a moment, and then he leant back again.
The stranger glanced from one to another, and then his eyes
rested for a moment admiringly on Mary&rsquo;s face&mdash;and who
could wonder! A sweeter picture and one more full of harmonious
contrast could hardly be seen than the young girl with her hair
somewhat negligently and yet neatly turned back from her
forehead, her dress partly her own and partly the coarser
garments of her hostess&rsquo;s daughter, sitting in that plain
old massive kitchen, giving refinement and gaining simplicity,
with the mingled glow of health and bashfulness lending a special
brilliancy to her fair complexion. This was no ordinary
man&rsquo;s child the stranger saw, and again he expressed his
willingness to retire and make his way to the town rather than
intrude his company on those who might prefer greater
privacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit ye down, man, sit ye down,&rdquo; said Hodges;
&ldquo;the ladies &rsquo;ll do very well, the kitchen&rsquo;s a
good big un, so there&rsquo;s room for ye all. Have you crossed
the brook? You&rsquo;d find it no easy matter unless you came
over the foot bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, my friend, to say,&rdquo; was the
reply, &ldquo;that I have both crossed the brook and been
<i>in</i> it. I was about to go over by a little bridge a mile or
so farther down, when I thought I saw some creature or other
struggling in the water. I stooped down, and to my surprise and
consternation found that it was a man. I plunged into the stream
and contrived to drag him to the bank, but he was evidently quite
dead. What I had taken for struggling was only the force of the
stream swaying him about against the supports of the bridge. His
dress was that of a coachman or driver of some public conveyance.
I got help from a neighbouring cottage, and we carried him in,
and I sent someone off for the nearest doctor, and then I thought
to take a short cut into the road, and I&rsquo;ve been wandering
about for a long time now, and am very thankful to find any
shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this account Mrs Franklin and her daughter turned
deadly pale, and then the former exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear it was our poor driver&mdash;I heard a splash
while our omnibus was struggling in the water. Oh! I fear, I fear
it must have been the unfortunate man; and oh! Poor man,
I&rsquo;m afraid he wasn&rsquo;t in a fit state to
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he was like your young friend at the forge, I fear
not indeed,&rdquo; said Mr Tankardew. <img src=
"images/nlost055.jpg" alt="" /> &ldquo;That drink that accursed
drink,&rdquo; he added, rising and approaching the stranger, who
was now divesting himself of his wet outer garments. He was tall,
as we have said, and his figure was slight and graceful; he wore
a thick black beard and moustache, and had something of a
military air; his eyes were piercing and restless, and seemed to
take in at a glance and comprehend whatever they rested on.</p>
<p>But what was there in him that seemed familiar to Mrs Franklin
and Mary? Had they seen him elsewhere? They felt sure that they
had not, and yet his voice and face both reminded them of someone
they had seen and heard before. The same thing seemed to strike
Mr Tankardew, but, as he turned towards the young stranger, the
latter started back and uttered a confused exclamation of
astonishment. The old man also was now strangely moved, he
muttered aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be&mdash;no&mdash;it cannot be: yes, it surely
must be;&rdquo; then he seemed to restrain himself by a sudden
effort, he paused for a moment, and then with two rapid strides
he reached the young man, placed his left hand upon the
other&rsquo;s lips, and seizing him by the right hand hurried him
out of the kitchen before another word could be spoken.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs Franklin and her daughter looked on in astonishment,
hardly knowing what to say or think of this extraordinary
proceeding, but their host reassured them at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear, ma&rsquo;am, the old mayster couldn&rsquo;t
hurt a fly; it&rsquo;ll be all right, take my word for it;
there&rsquo;s summut strange as <i>we</i> can&rsquo;t make out. I
think I sees a little into it, but it is not for me to speak if
the mayster wants to keep things secret. It&rsquo;ll all turn out
right in the end, you may be sure. The old mayster&rsquo;s been
getting a bit of a shake of late, but it is a shake of the right
sort. He&rsquo;s been coming out of some of his odd ways and
giving his mind to better things. He&rsquo;s had his heart broke
once, but it seems to me as he&rsquo;s been getting it mended
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next half hour, the farmer, his wife, and daughter
were busy about their home concerns, and their two guests were
left to their own meditations.</p>
<p>At last a distant door opened, and Mr Tankardew appeared
followed by the young stranger. By the flickering fire Mrs
Franklin thought she saw the traces of tears on both faces, and
there was a strange light in the old man&rsquo;s eyes which she
had not seen there before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me introduce you to a young friend and an old
friend in one,&rdquo; he said, addressing the ladies; &ldquo;this
is Mr John Randolph, a great traveller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Franklin said some kind words expressive of her pleasure
in seeing the gratification Mr Tankardew felt in this renewal of
acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Yes,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;you may well
say gratification. Why, I&rsquo;ve known this young
gentleman&rsquo;s father ever since I can remember. Sam,&rdquo;
he added to the farmer, who had just come in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to run away with our young friend here, we shall both take
up our quarters at the inn for to-night. I see it is fairer now.
Mrs Franklin, pray make yourself quite easy. I shall despatch a
messenger at once to &lsquo;The Shrubbery&rsquo; with full
particulars. Good-night! Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Mary and her mother were left to their own musings and
conjectures, for the farmer and his family made no allusion
afterwards to the events of the evening.</p>

<h3>Chapter Five.</h3>
<h4>The Young Musician.</h4>
<p>A Grand piano being carried into Mr Esau Tankardew&rsquo;s!
What next! What <i>can</i> the old gentleman want with a grand
piano? Most likely he has taken it for a bad debt&mdash;some
tenant sold up. But say what they may, the fact is the same. And,
stranger still, a tuner pays a visit to put the instrument in
tune. What can it all mean? Marvellous reports, too, tell of a
sudden domestic revolution. The dust and cobwebs have had notice
to quit, brooms and brushes have travelled into corners and
crevices hitherto unexplored, the piano rests in a parlour which
smiles in the gaiety of a new carpet and new curtains; prints
have come to light upon the walls, chairs and tables have taken
heart, and now wear an honest gloss upon their legs and faces;
ornaments, which had hitherto been too dirty to be ornamental,
now show themselves in their real colours. Outside the house,
also, wonderful things have come to pass; the rocking doorstep is
at rest, and its fellow has been adjusted to a proper level;
<i>ever</i>-greens have taken the place of the old
<i>never</i>-greens; knocker and door handle are not ashamed to
show their native brass; the missing rails have returned to their
duty in the ranks. The whole establishment, including its master,
has emerged out of a state of foggy dilapidation. Old Molly
Gilders has retired into the interior, and given place above
stairs to a dapper damsel. As for the ghosts, they could not be
expected to remain under such <i>dispiriting</i> circumstances,
and have had the good sense to resort to some more congenial
dwelling.</p>
<p>While gossip on this unlooked-for transformation was still
flying in hot haste about Hopeworth and the neighbourhood, the
families both at &ldquo;The Firs&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Shrubbery&rdquo; were greatly astonished one morning by an
invitation to spend an evening at Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr Rothwell, &ldquo;I suppose it
won&rsquo;t do to decline; the old gentleman means it, no doubt,
as an attention, and it would not be politic to vex
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure, my dear,&rdquo; said his wife,
&ldquo;<i>I</i> can&rsquo;t think of going. I shall be bored to
death; you must make my excuses and accept the invitation for the
girls. I don&rsquo;t suppose Mark will care to go; the old man
seems to have a spite against him&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell
why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; interposed Mark, &ldquo;if it be
only to see the fun. I&rsquo;ll be on my good behaviour.
I&rsquo;ll call for tea and toast-and-water at regular intervals
all through the evening, and then the old gentleman will be sure
to put me down for something handsome in his will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take some music with you,&rdquo;
said his mother, turning to her eldest daughter; &ldquo;Mr
Tankardew has got his new piano on purpose, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, do,&rdquo; cried Mark; &ldquo;take something
lively, and you&rsquo;ll fetch out the old spiders and
daddy-long-legs which have been sent into the corners like
naughty boys, and they&rsquo;ll come out by millions and dance
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was settled that the invitation should be accepted. The
surprise at &ldquo;The Shrubbery&rdquo; was of a more agreeable
kind. Mrs Franklin and her daughter had learnt to love the old
man, in spite of his eccentricities; they saw the sterling
strength and consistency of his character. They had, however,
hardly expected such an invitation; but the reports of the
strange changes in progress in Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s dwelling had
reached their ears, so that it was evident that he was intending,
for some unknown reasons, to break through the reserve and
retirement of years, and let a little more light and sociability
into the inner recesses of his establishment. That he had a
special object in doing this they felt assured; what that object
was they could not divine. Had Mrs Franklin known that the
Rothwells had been asked, she would have declined the invitation;
but she was unaware of this till she had agreed to go; it was
then too late to draw back.</p>
<p>All the guests were very punctual on the appointed evening,
curiosity having acted as a stimulant with the Rothwells of a
more wholesome kind than they were in the habit of imbibing. What
a change! It was now the end of October, and the evenings were
chilly, so that all were glad of the cheery fire, partly of wood
and partly of coal, which threw its brightness all abroad in
flashes of restless light. Old pictures, apparently family
portraits, adorned the walls, relieved by prints of a more modern
and lively appearance. One space was bare, where a portrait might
have been expected as a match to another on the other side of the
fireplace. The omission struck every one at once on entering. The
furniture, generally, was old-fashioned, and somewhat subdued in
its tints, as though it had long languished under the cold shade
of neglect, and had passed its best days in obscurity.</p>
<p>Not many minutes, however, were given to the guests for
observation, for Mr Tankardew soon appeared in evening costume,
accompanied by the young stranger who had taken refuge on the
night of the storm in Samuel Hodges&rsquo; farm kitchen. Mr
Tankardew introduced him to the Rothwells as Mr John Randolph, an
old-young friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known his father sixty years
and more,&rdquo; he said; then he added, &ldquo;my young friend
has travelled a good deal, and will have some curiosities to show
you by-and-by&mdash;but now let us have tea. Mrs Franklin, pray
do me the honour to preside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While tea was in progress, Mr Tankardew suddenly surprised his
guests by remarking dryly, and abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know, ladies and gentlemen, that my mother was
a brewer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr Rothwell, in considerable
astonishment; and then asked, &ldquo;was the business an
extensive one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well, pretty well,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;She brewed every morning and night, but she&rsquo;d only
one <i>dray</i> and that was a <i>tray</i>, and she&rsquo;d a
famous large teapot for a vat; we never used hops nor sent our
barley to be malted, what little we used we gave to the fowls;
and we never felt the want of porter, or pale ale, or bitter
beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity that more people are not of your
mother&rsquo;s mind,&rdquo; said Mrs Franklin, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is indeed; but I shouldn&rsquo;t, perhaps, have
said anything about it, only the teapot you&rsquo;ve got in your
hand now was my dear old mother&rsquo;s brewery, and that set me
thinking and talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not their host&rsquo;s fault, nor Mr John
Randolph&rsquo;s, who acted as joint entertainer, if their guests
did not make a hearty tea. The meal concluded, Mr Tankardew
requested his young friend to bring out some of his curiosities.
These greatly interested all the party&mdash;especially Mrs
Franklin and Mary, who were delighted with the traveller&rsquo;s
liveliness and intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show our friends some of your sketches,&rdquo; said the
old man. These were produced, and were principally in water
colours, evidently being the work of a master&rsquo;s hand. As he
turned to a rather un-English scene, the young artist sighed and
said, &ldquo;I have some very sad remembrances connected with
that sketch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray let us have them,&rdquo; said Mr Tankardew. Mr
Randolph complied, and proceeded: &ldquo;This is an Australian
sketch: you see those curious-looking trees, they are blue and
red gums: there is the wattle, too, with its almond-scented
flowers, and the native lilac. That cottage in the foreground was
put up by an enterprising colonist, who went out from England
some fifteen years ago; you see how lovely its situation is with
its background of hills. I was out late one evening with a young
companion, and we were rather jaded with walking, when we came
upon this cottage. We stood upon no ceremony, but marched in and
craved hospitality, which no one in the bush ever dreamt of
refusing. We found the whole family at supper: the father had
died about a year before of consumption, after he had fenced in
his three acres and built his house, and planted vineyard and
peach orchard. There were sheep, too, with a black fellow for a
shepherd, and a stock yard with some fine bullocks in it;
altogether, it was a tidy little property, and a blooming family
to manage it. The widow sat at the head of the table, and her
son, a young man of two-and-twenty, next to her. There were three
younger children, two girls and a boy, all looking bright and
healthy. We had a hearty welcome, and poured out news while they
poured out tea, which with damper (an Australian cake baked on
the hearth), and mutton made an excellent meal. When tea was over
we had a good long talk, and found that the young farmer was an
excellent son, and in a fair way to establish the whole family in
prosperity. Well, the time came for parting, they pressed us to
stay the night, but we could not. <img src="images/nlost067.jpg"
alt="" /> Just as we were leaving, my companion took out a flask
of spirits, and said, &lsquo;Come, let us drink to our next happy
meeting, and success to the farm.&rsquo; I shall never forget the
look of the poor mother, nor of the young man himself; the old
woman turned very pale, and the son very red, and said,
&lsquo;Thank you all the same, I&rsquo;ve done with these things,
I&rsquo;ve had too much of them.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh!
Nonsense,&rsquo; my friend said; &lsquo;a little drop won&rsquo;t
hurt you, perhaps we may never meet again.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, I
don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said the other, in a sort of irresolute
way. I could see he was thirsting for the drink, for his eye
sparkled when the flask was produced. I whispered to my friend to
forbear, but he would not. &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; he said;
&lsquo;just a little can do them no harm, it is only friendly to
offer it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Just a taste, then, merely a
taste,&rsquo; said our host, and produced glasses. The mother
tried to interfere, but her son frowned her into silence. So grog
was made, and the younger ones, too, must taste it, and before we
left the flask had been emptied. I took none myself, for never
has a drop of intoxicants passed my lips since I first left my
English home. I spoke strongly to my companion when we were on
our way again, but he only laughed at me, and said,
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the harm?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what <i>was</i> the harm?&rdquo; asked Mark, in a
rather sarcastic tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; replied John Randolph, quietly.
&ldquo;Four years later I passed alone across the same track, and
thought I would look in on my old entertainer. I found the place,
but where were the owners? All was still as death, little of the
fence remained, the stock yard was all to pieces, the garden was
a wilderness, the cottage a wreck. I made inquiries afterward
very diligently, and heard that the young farmer had taken to
drinking, that the younger children had followed his example, the
poor mother was in her grave, and her eldest son a disreputable
vagabond; where the rest were no one knew. Oh! I resolved when I
heard it that never would I under any circumstances offer
intoxicating drinks to others, as I had previously, while myself
a total abstainer, occasionally done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said Mr Rothwell, &ldquo;we are not
answerable for the abuse which others may make of what is lawful
and useful if taken in moderation. The other day I offered the
guard of my train a glass of ale; he took it; afterward the train
ran off the line through his neglect; it seems he was drunken,
but he appeared all right when I gave him the ale; surely I was
not answerable there? The guard ought to have stopped and refused
when he knew he had had enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not answerable for the accident, perhaps,&rdquo;
said Mr Tankardew; &ldquo;but your case and the case just related
by my young friend are not quite parallel, for his companion knew
that the farmer had, by his own confession, been in the habit of
exceeding; <i>you</i> didn&rsquo;t know but that the guard was a
moderate man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;I
presumed, of course, that he knew when to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, my dear sir,&rdquo; rejoined the old man,
earnestly, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it perilous work offering a
stimulant which is so ruinous to tens of thousands, and has
emptied multitudes of homes of health, and peace, and
character?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it may be so; I&rsquo;m certainly beginning to
think it anything but wise getting children into the habit of
liking these things;&rdquo; and he glanced anxiously at Mark, who
appeared intensely absorbed in looking at some photographs upside
down.</p>
<p>There was a few moments&rsquo; pause, and then the old man
said, &ldquo;Come, let us have a little music, perhaps Miss
Rothwell will favour us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing loth, the young lady led off in a brilliant sonata,
displaying in the execution more strength of muscle than purity
of taste; then came a duet by the eldest and youngest sisters,
and then a song by the second. Mr Tankardew expressed his
satisfaction emphatically at the conclusion, possibly more at
finding the performance ended than at the performance itself.</p>
<p>Mr John Randolph then seated himself at the piano, at the
host&rsquo;s request, and addressed himself to his work with a
loving earnestness that showed that the soul of music dwelt
within him. The very first chords he struck riveted at once the
attention of every one, an attention which was deepened into
surprised delight, as he executed with perfect finish passages of
surpassing brilliancy growing out of the national airs of many
countries&mdash;airs which floated out from the entanglements of
the more rapid portions with an earnest pathos that held every
hearer as with a spell of enchantment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvellous, marvellous! Bravo!&rdquo; cried both Mr
Rothwell and Mark at the conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; said Mr Tankardew, &ldquo;will
be glad to give lessons in music, as an occupation. He will be
making my house his home at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight expression of surprise on every face, and
of something like scorn or contempt on the Rothwells&rsquo;.
However, both the young ladies at &ldquo;The Firs&rdquo; and Mrs
Franklin expressed their wish to engage Mr Randolph&rsquo;s
services, and so it was arranged.</p>
<hr /></div>
<div class="bodytext"><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a>
<h3>Chapter Six.</h3>
<h4>Heartless Work.</h4>
<p>Music certainly flourished at &ldquo;The Firs&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Shrubbery&rdquo; under the able instructions of Mr
John Randolph. The young man&rsquo;s manner was puzzling to his
pupils at both houses. With the Misses Rothwell (who gave
<i>themselves</i> airs, besides practising those which were given
them by their master), he was quietly civil and deferential, and
yet made them sensible of his superiority to them in a way which
they could not help feeling, and yet equally could not resent.
With Mary Franklin his respectful manner was mingled with an
almost tenderness, ever kept in check by a cautious
self-restraint. What did it mean? It made her feel embarrassed
and almost unhappy. She had no wish to entangle the young
musician&rsquo;s affections, and indeed felt that her own were
getting entangled with Mark Rothwell. Mark contrived to throw
himself a good deal in her way at this time, far more than her
mother liked, but Mr Rothwell himself seemed bent on promoting
the intimacy, and his son laid himself out to please. There was,
moreover, rankling in Mary&rsquo;s heart the impression that Mark
was being harshly judged by her mother; this helped to draw her
closer to him. He was, besides, an excellent performer on the
flute, and would sometimes come over on lesson mornings and
accompany her, much to the annoyance of her instructor.</p>
<p>On one of these occasions, a little more than a year after the
party at his house, Mr Tankardew was present, having made an
unusually early call. Mark wished him gone, and when the music
lesson was over, and Mr Randolph had retired, hoped that the old
man would take his leave; but nothing seemed farther from that
gentleman&rsquo;s thoughts, so that Mark was obliged to bottle up
his wrath (the only spirit, alas! That he ever did bottle up),
and to leave Mr Tankardew in possession. When he was gone, the
old man looked keenly at mother and daughter. Mrs Franklin
coloured and sighed. Mary turned very red and then very pale, and
took an earnest passing interest in the pattern of the
hearthrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very musical young gentleman, Mr Mark
Rothwell,&rdquo; said their visitor dryly. &ldquo;I wish
he&rsquo;d breathe as much harmony into his home as he breathes
melody out of his flute.&rdquo; Neither mother nor daughter
spoke, but Mary&rsquo;s heart beat very fast. &ldquo;Hem! I
see,&rdquo; continued the other, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t believe
it! Only slander, malice, lies. Well, take my word for it, the
love that comes out of the brandy flask will never get into the
teapot. I wish you both a very good morning; ay, better one than
this, a great deal;&rdquo; and with a sternness of manner quite
unusual, the old man took his leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cruel! How unjust!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary, when Mr
Tankardew was gone. &ldquo;Poor Mark! Every one strikes at
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But <i>was</i> it cruel? <i>was</i> it unjust? Let us go with
Mark Rothwell himself, as he leaves his house that very night,
sneaking out at the backdoor like a felon.</p>
<p>A few hundred yards to the rear of the outbuildings stood a
neat and roomy cottage; this was occupied by John Gubbins, the
coachman, a man bound to Mark by unlimited donations of beer, and
equally bound to a gang of swindlers who had floated their way to
his pocket and privacy on the waves of strong drink. John had
been gambling with these men, and had of course lost his money to
them, and somebody else&rsquo;s too: the hard-earned savings of
one of the maids who had trusted him to put them in the bank: of
course he meant to repay them, with interest; that is to say,
when the luck turned in his favour; but luck, like fortune, is
blind, and tramples on those who court her most. It was very dark
outside, as Mark groped his way along; but a muffled light showed
him where the cottage window was. Three times he gave a long, low
whistle, and then knocked four distinct raps on the door, which
was cautiously opened by a man with a profusion of hair, beard
and whiskers, which looked as though they did not belong to him,
as was probably the case, not only with his hair, but with
everything else that he wore, including some tarnished
ornaments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir, come in,&rdquo; he said, and Mark
entered.</p>
<p>What a scene for a young man brought up as he had been! Could
he really find any satisfaction in it? Yes, birds that love
carrion flock together, and there was plenty of moral carrion
here. A long deal table occupied the middle of the room, a
smaller round one stood under the window and supported a tray
loaded with glasses and pipes, with a tall black bottle in the
midst of them. The glasses were turned upside down for the
present, a pity it should not have been for the future too; they
looked with the bottle in the centre like a little congregation
surrounding a preacher. Oh! What a sermon of woe that bottle
might have preached to them! But it didn&rsquo;t speak; it was to
set on fire the tongues of other speakers. There was a coloured
print over the mantelpiece of Moses smiting the rock. What a
solemn contrast to the streams of fire-water soon about to flow!
John Gubbins sat at the top of the table, looking fat and
anxious, half shy and half foolish; the man with the false hair
and ornaments placed himself next to him. Three other strangers
were present, a mixture of sham gentility and swagger, of whom it
would be difficult to say which had descended into the lowest
depths of blackguardism. And now business was begun; the glasses
were transferred to the larger table, the bottle uncorked, lemons
and sugar produced, and the poor kettle, made for better things,
forced to defile its healthful contents by mixture with liquid
madness, in the shape of whisky; then out came cards and dice.
But what sound was that? Three very faint trembling whistles,
followed by four equally feeble taps at the door? Another madman,
who was he? Could it really be Jim Forbes, the footman, that
respectable, steady-looking young man, who waited daily at the
dining tables? Alas! It was indeed. Jim was the son of a poor
widow, whose husband, a small farmer, had died of fever, leaving
behind him a large family, a small cottage, smaller savings, and
a good character; Jim was the eldest sort, and next to him was a
poor crippled sister, whose patient hands added a little to the
common stock by sewing; Jim, however, had been his widowed
mother&rsquo;s mainstay since his father&rsquo;s death, and a
willing, loving helper he was: ay, he <i>had</i> been, but was he
still? Jim had got a place at &ldquo;The Firs&rdquo;; first of
all as a general helper, then as a footman, in which latter
capacity he enjoyed the very questionable privilege of waiting at
table, and hearing what was said at meals by Mr and Mrs Rothwell,
their children, and guests. What Jim learnt on these occasions
was this, that money and strong drink were the chief things worth
living for. He didn&rsquo;t believe it at first, for he saw in
his mother&rsquo;s cottage real happiness where there was little
money and less alcohol; he saw, too, on his suffering
sister&rsquo;s brow a gilding of heaven&rsquo;s sunshine more
lovely than burnished gold, and a smile on her thin pale lips,
which grace and love made sweeter than the most sparkling laugh
of unsanctified beauty. Still, what he heard so constantly on the
lips of those better educated than himself left its mark; he
began to long for things out of his reach, and to pilfer a little
and then a little more of what <i>was</i> in his reach, not
money, but drink. Indeed he heard so much about betting and
gambling, his master&rsquo;s guests seemed to find the cards and
the dice box so convenient a way of slipping a few pounds out of
a friend&rsquo;s pocket into their own without the trouble of
giving an equivalent, that poor Jim got confused. True, he had
learnt in the eighth commandment, when a boy, the words,
&ldquo;Thou shalt not steal&rdquo;; but these better-informed
guests at Mr Rothwell&rsquo;s seemed able to take a flying leap
over this scriptural barrier without any trouble, so he swallowed
his scruples and his master&rsquo;s wine at the same time, and
thought he should like to have an opportunity of turning a snug
little legacy of a hundred pounds, left him by an uncle, into
something handsomer by a lucky venture or two. Conscience was not
satisfied at first, but he silenced it by telling himself that he
was going to enrich his poor mother, and make a lady of his
crippled sister. Somehow or other there is a strange attraction
that draws together kindred spirits in evil. Mark Rothwell found
out what was going on in Jim&rsquo;s mind, and determined to make
use of him; only, of course, so as to get himself out of a little
difficulty. Oh! No! He meant the poor lad no harm; nay, he
intended to put him in the way of making his fortune. So one day
after dinner Mark and the young man were closeted together for an
hour in the butler&rsquo;s pantry; wine flowed freely, and Jim
was given to understand that his young master was quite willing
to admit his humble companion into a choice little society of
friends who were to meet at the coachman&rsquo;s cottage on
certain evenings, and play games of chance, in which, after due
instruction from Mark, a person of Jim&rsquo;s intelligence would
be sure to win a golden harvest without the tedious process of
tilling and sowing. The instructions commenced there and then in
the pantry; several games were played, nearly all of which Jim
won to his great delight. They only played &ldquo;for love&rdquo;
this time, Mark said, but it was difficult to see where the
&ldquo;love&rdquo; was, except for the drink, and there was
plenty of that. One little favour, however, was required by the
young master, for initiating Jim into the mysteries and miseries
of gambling, and that was that he should lend his instructor what
money he could spare, as Mark happened to be rather short just at
this time. So Jim drew out a part of his legacy from the bank,
and deposited half in Mark&rsquo;s hands; the other half he took
with him to the coachman&rsquo;s cottage. Oh! It was a grand
thing to be allowed to sit with such company, and to hear the
wonderful stories of the gentlemen who condescended to come and
place their stores of gold and silver within a poor
footman&rsquo;s reach. What with the tales, and the songs, and
the whisky punch, Jim thought himself the happiest fellow alive
the first night he joined the party, especially when he found
himself the winner of three or four bright sovereigns, which had
become his own for the mere throwing down of a few cards, and a
rattle or two of the dice box. But all was not so pleasant the
next morning. Jim awoke with a sick headache and a sore heart.
And what should he do with his winnings? He would take them to
his mother: nay, the very thought stung him like a serpent. His
mother would want to know how he got the gold; or, when he threw
it into her lap, she would say, &ldquo;The Lord bless you, Jimmy,
and give it you back a hundredfold&rdquo;; and his sister would
clasp her wasted hands in thankfulness, and he could not bear to
think of a mother&rsquo;s blessing and a sister&rsquo;s prayers
over gains that were tainted with the leprosy of sin. So he kept
the money, and the next night of meeting he lost it, and more
besides; and then another night he was a gainer; and the
gambler&rsquo;s thirst grew strong in him. But loss soon followed
loss. His legacy was slipping surely down into the pockets of his
new friends. Cruel! Cruel! Heartless Mark! And oh! The cursed
drink! What meanness is there to which it will not lead its
slaves?</p>
<p>And now the night came we have before referred to. John
Gubbins sat at the top of the table; Jim Forbes took his place
near him. The spirits went round; the cards and dice were busy.
John Gubbins lost, and Mark won. Jim Forbes lost; and his cheeks
flushed, and his eyes glittered with excitement, and he ground
his teeth together. The strangers affected to be surprised at his
ill luck; really they couldn&rsquo;t understand it, they said;
they were quite sorry for him; but, &ldquo;nothing venture,
nothing win&rdquo;; <i>his</i> turn would come next. But it did
not come that night. Jim had now drawn the whole of his legacy
from the bank. The last sovereign was staked; it was lost. He
sprang to his feet, seized the uncut pack of cards, and hurled it
to the further end of the room; then he shook his fist at his new
companions, calling them cheats and villains. Up darted the man
with the exuberant hair, and up rose Mark and Gubbins. But what
was <i>that</i>? A strange noise outside. The dog in the kennel
muttered a low growl, and then began to bark furiously; then the
approach of footsteps was plain; a deathlike stillness fell on
the whole party; the strangers caught up the cards and dice, and
looked this way and that, pale and aghast. And now there came a
loud and peremptory knocking at the door, as of men who were
determined to find entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked Gubbins, in quivering
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; was the reply from a deep, loud
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, by no means, do nothing of the sort, at
this unseasonable hour,&rdquo; said the coachman, a little more
boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door, or I&rsquo;ll force it,&rdquo; said the
same voice.</p>
<p>Poor Mark! And poor, wretched Jim! How utterly guilty and
crestfallen they looked! As for the gamblers, they cowered
together, in abject terror, not daring to attempt a retreat by
the back, lest the enemy should be lurking for them there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you open the door, or will you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer from within.</p>
<img src="images/nlost079.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Then came a tremendous blow; then a foot was seen forcing its
way over the doorsill, another moment, and the barrier to the
entrance of the invaders gave way with a rattling crash.</p>
<hr /></div>
<div class="bodytext"><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a>
<h3>Chapter Seven.</h3>
<h4>Bitter Fruit.</h4>
<p>No sooner was the door burst open, than in rushed several
stout men, who proceeded to seize and handcuff the four
strangers, who made but the faintest show of resistance. John
Gubbins shook with abject terror, as he tried in vain to double
up his fat person into a small compass in a corner. Jim Forbes
stood speechless for a moment, and then darted out through the
open doorway. As for Mark Rothwell, what with shame and dismay,
and semi-intoxication from whisky punch, his position and
appearance were anything but enviable. He recovered himself,
however, in a few minutes, and turned fiercely on the
intruders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what right, and by whose authority,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;do you dare to break into my coachman&rsquo;s house, and
to lay violent hands on these gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this warrant, young sir,&rdquo; said the chief of
the invading party, producing a parchment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
detective; I&rsquo;ve been looking after these <i>gentlemen</i> a
long time; they are part of a regular gang of pickpockets and
swindlers, and we&rsquo;ve a case or two against &rsquo;em as
&rsquo;ll keep &rsquo;em at home, under lock and key, for a bit.
I&rsquo;m sorry we&rsquo;ve been so rough, but I was afraid of
losing &rsquo;em. I didn&rsquo;t think to find &rsquo;em in such
company, and I hope, young gent, if you&rsquo;ll let me give you
a word of advice, that you&rsquo;ll keep clear of such as these
for the future for your own sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas! Poor Mark! Crestfallen and wretched, he slunk away
home.</p>
<p>And what had become of Jim Forbes? Nobody knew at &ldquo;The
Firs.&rdquo; He was missing that night and the next day. Mr
Rothwell asked for him at breakfast, and was told that he had not
slept in the house the night before, and was nowhere to be found.
The day passed away, but Jim did not make his appearance.</p>
<p>It was a dark November evening: a dim light twinkled through
the casement of Mrs Forbes&rsquo; cottage: the wind was whistling
and sighing mournfully, sometimes lulling for a while, and then
rising and rushing through crack and crevice with a wild
complaining moan. Inside that little dwelling were weeping eyes
and aching hearts. Upstairs all was peace; four little children
lay fast asleep in the inner chamber, twined in each
other&rsquo;s ruddy arms, their regular breathing contrasting, in
its deep peace, with the fitful sighings of the wind; yet on the
long eyelashes of one of the little sleepers there stood a
glistening tear, and from the parted lips there came, now and
again, the words, &ldquo;Brother Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But ah! No blessed sleep stilled the throbbing hearts of those
who cowered over the scanty fire in the kitchen below;
Jim&rsquo;s mother and crippled sister. Was it poverty that made
them sad? No. Poverty was there, but it was very neat and cleanly
poverty. No, it was not poverty that wrung the bitter tears from
the eyes of those heart-sick watchers; they were rich in faith;
they could trust God; they could afford to wait. It wasn&rsquo;t
<i>that</i>. Jim! Poor Jim! Poor erring Jim! How changed he had
been of late; none of his old brightness; none of his old love.
It wasn&rsquo;t so much that he brought his mother no welcome
help now; it was hard to miss it, but she could battle on
without. It wasn&rsquo;t that crippled Sally&rsquo;s cheek grew
paler because she was forced to do without the little comforts
supplied so long by a brother&rsquo;s thoughtful love, though it
was harder still to miss these. No, but it was that mother and
daughter both saw, too plainly, that Jim was going down-hill, and
that too with quickening steps. They saw that he was getting the
slave of the drink, and they feared that there was worse behind;
and, of course, there was: for when did ever the drink-fiend get
an immortal being into his grasp without bringing a companion
demon along with him? And now, this very day, Jim was reported to
them as being missing from &ldquo;The Firs,&rdquo; and dark
suspicions and terrible rumours were afloat, and John
Gubbins&rsquo; name and the young master&rsquo;s name were mixed
up with them. Mother and daughter sat there together by the dying
embers, and shuddered closer to one another at each moaning of
the blast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother! I&rsquo;m heartbroke,&rdquo; at last burst
out from the poor girl&rsquo;s lips: &ldquo;to think of our Jim,
so kind, so good, &rsquo;ticed away by that miserable drink, and
gone nobody knows where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Hush! Child, ye mustn&rsquo;t fret; I&rsquo;ve
faith to believe as the Lord &rsquo;ll not forsake us:
He&rsquo;ll bring our Jim back again: He&rsquo;ll hear a
mother&rsquo;s prayer: He&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here a sudden sound of uneven footsteps made the poor
widow start to <img src="images/nlost087.jpg" alt="" /> her feet,
and Sally to cry out. The next moment the door was rudely shaken,
and then Jim staggered into the room, haggard, blear-eyed,
muttering to himself savagely. The sight of his mother and sister
seemed partially to sober him, for the spirit within him bowed
instinctively before the beauty of holiness, which neither
poverty nor terror could obliterate from the face of those whom
he used to love so dearly. But the spell was soon broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to do
here? I want my supper; I haven&rsquo;t scarce tasted to-day, and
nobody cares for me no more nor a dog. I say, mother, stir
yourself, and get me my supper.&rdquo; He flung himself into a
chair, with an oath, as he almost lost his balance.</p>
<p>Oh! Misery! Misery! Every word was a separate stab, but Mrs
Forbes restrained herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, dear,&rdquo; she said, soothingly,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve nothing in the house for supper: we
didn&rsquo;t expect you: we hoped you&rsquo;d gone back to your
master&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! There it is! Didn&rsquo;t expect me! No supper!
This is all I&rsquo;m to get after spending all my wages on them
as don&rsquo;t care to give me a mouthful of meat and a drop of
drink when I want &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim! Jim! Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; exclaimed his poor
sister, &ldquo;oh! Don&rsquo;t! For the Lord&rsquo;s sake!
You&rsquo;ll repent it bitterly by-and-by! Oh! It can&rsquo;t be
our dear, kind Jim, as God sent to help and comfort us!
We&rsquo;d give you meat and drink, if we had them, but the last
crumb&rsquo;s gone, and mother&rsquo;s never bitten
to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Don&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i>! None of your
humbug and cant with me! If I can&rsquo;t get supper where I
ought, I&rsquo;ll get it where I can! I&rsquo;ll not darken this
door again as sure as my name&rsquo;s Jim Forbes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a scowl, and a curse, and a slam of the door that
startled the little ones from their sleep, the miserable son
flung himself out of his home. The next day he enlisted; the day
following he was gone altogether.</p>
<p>Weep! Weep! Ye holy angels! Howl with savage glee, ye mocking
fiends! See what the drink can do! And yet, O wondrous strange!
There are thinking men, loving men, Christian men, who tell us we
are wrong, we are mad in trying to pluck the intoxicating cup
away from men and women, and to keep it wholly out of the hands
of little children and upgrowing boys and girls. Mad are we? Be
it so; but there&rsquo;s method, there&rsquo;s holy love,
there&rsquo;s heavenly wisdom in our madness.</p>
<p>A month had passed away, but no tidings of Jim Forbes; no
letter telling of penitence or love. Oh! If he would only write:
only just a word: only to say, &ldquo;Mother, sister, I love you
still.&rdquo; But no; hearts must wither, hearts must break, as
the idol car of intemperance holds on its way, crushing out life
temporal and eternal from thousands and tens of thousands who
throw themselves madly under its wheels. But must it be so for
ever?&mdash;No! It cannot, it shall not be, God helping us; for
their rises up a cry to heaven against the unholy traffic in
strong drink; a cry that <i>must</i> be heard.</p>
<p>The snow was falling fast, but not faster nor more softly than
the tears of the widowed mother and the crippled daughter, as
they bowed themselves down before the cold bars, which ought to
have enclosed a mass of glowing coals on that pitiless December
day; but only a dull red spark or two, amid a heap of dust, just
twinkled in the grate, and seemed to mock their wretchedness.
Cold! Cold! Everything was cold there but faith and love. Food
there was none! But on the little table lay the open Bible; and
just beneath those weary, swollen <i>eyes</i>, were the words,
&ldquo;They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more,
neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat; for the Lamb
which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and lead
them to living fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes.&rdquo; But what were those voices? Were
they the voices of angels? Poor, shivering, weary watchers! They
might almost seem so to you. Anyhow, they were very gentle,
loving voices; and now they ask admittance. Mrs Franklin and Mary
entered; and, though not angels, they were come to do
angels&rsquo; work, as messengers of love and mercy. Tea, and
bread and butter, and eggs, and divers other comforts came
suddenly to light from under the wide folds of the ladies&rsquo;
cloaks, and then the visitors sat down, and stopped the outburst
of tearful thanks by bright loving words of pity and
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am! It is true, but I never knowed afore
how true it was that God will never forsake His own. I&rsquo;d
well nigh given up all for lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, mother,&rdquo; said Sally; &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t
you, it was me; <i>your</i> faith held out still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very, very sorry to hear of your troubles,&rdquo;
said Mrs Franklin after a pause; &ldquo;but you mustn&rsquo;t
despair; God will bring your poor son back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I believe it, ma&rsquo;am, but it is hard not to
doubt when one&rsquo;s cold and hunger-bitten; he was such a good
lad to us afore he took to that miserable drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must pray for him, and I daresay Mr and Mrs
Rothwell will stand your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends! Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried the poor woman;
&ldquo;oh! You don&rsquo;t know, ma&rsquo;am; look, ma&rsquo;am,
at yon empty cupboard; there ought to be meat and drink there,
ma&rsquo;am, and earned by honest labour. It is not an hour,
ma&rsquo;am, since I was up at &lsquo;The Firs,&rsquo; taking
back some work as my poor Sally did for the young ladies
(she&rsquo;s a beautiful sewer, is our Sally, there&rsquo;s none
to match her in all Hopeworth), and I&rsquo;d a fortnight&rsquo;s
charing as I was owed for. I&rsquo;d left the little ones with a
kind neighbour, so I went up to the house and asked to see the
missus: she couldn&rsquo;t see me, but I begged hard; and they
showed me up into the drawing-room. Mrs Rothwell was lying on a
&lsquo;sofy,&rsquo; and there was wine on a table close by, and
the young ladies was all crowding round the fire, contradicting
their mother, and quarrelling with one another. &lsquo;Oh! For
goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t interrupt us,&rsquo; says one of
the young ladies, and their mamma bids me sit down; and there I
sat for a long time, till Miss Jane had finished a fairy tale;
something about a young lady as was shut up in a castle to be
eaten by a giant; and how a young gentleman fell in love with
her, and got a fairy to turn her into a bird, and get her out of
the castle: and they all cried over the story as if their hearts
would break, and when it was over they all had some wine; and Mrs
Rothwell, who had been crying very much too, asked me what I
wanted. So I told her as I&rsquo;d come to my last penny, and I
should be very thankful if she&rsquo;d be so good as to pay me
for my work, and for what our Sally had been doing for the young
ladies. Then she fired up at once, and told me she thought it
very impertinent in me coming and teasing her in that way, as she
meant to pay me as soon as it was convenient; and oh!
Ma&rsquo;am! Then she asked me what I wanted for Sally&rsquo;s
work; and when I told her, she said I charged too much, though I
didn&rsquo;t ask above half as they&rsquo;d ask for it in
Hopeworth; and then she nearly cut my heart in two by saying (Oh,
ma&rsquo;am! I can&rsquo;t scarce bear to repeat it), that I
shouldn&rsquo;t have come to pester her if it hadn&rsquo;t been
for my idle vagabond of a son (them was the very words she used,
ma&rsquo;am), as had run away and left his place. Oh, Mrs
Franklin! You&rsquo;re a mother; you know how I must feel for my
poor wanderer, for he&rsquo;s my own flesh and blood still. I
dursn&rsquo;t speak; I couldn&rsquo;t stay; and I&rsquo;ve come
back penniless as I went: but the Lord has sent you to help me,
and I&rsquo;ll never doubt Him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never do,&rdquo; said her visitor; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
find you and Sally work for the present, and try and think
charitably of Mrs Rothwell; she may mean more kindly than she has
spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean kindly! Oh! Dear Mrs Franklin! The drink has
washed out all kindness: there&rsquo;s ruin hanging over that
house, not as I wishes it to them, but it is so. The
children&rsquo;s been brought up to think of just nothing but
themselves; their eating and drinking, and dressing, and playing:
there&rsquo;s sipping in the parlour all day long; drinking in
the dining-room; swilling in the kitchen. Our poor Jim&rsquo;s
seen his betters there living as if men, women, and children had
nothing to do in this world but to drown the thoughts of the next
in drink and pleasure, and he&rsquo;s learnt his lesson too well;
but I trust the Lord &rsquo;ll take the book out of his hand, and
teach him the better way again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid what you say is too true,&rdquo;
remarked Mrs Franklin, sadly; &ldquo;if our young people continue
to be brought up in such self-indulgent habits, we may well
expect to hear God crying aloud by His judgments, &lsquo;Woe to
the drunkards of England,&rsquo; as He once cried, &lsquo;Woe to
the drunkards of Ephraim.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<hr /></div>
<div class="bodytext"><a name="chap08" id="chap08"></a>
<h3>Chapter Eight.</h3>
<h4>A Double Peril.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Mark, I <i>must</i>
have a stop put to this: my patience is quite worn out. Do you
think I&rsquo;m made of money? Do you think I can coin money as
fast as you choose to spend it? You&rsquo;ll ruin me with your
thoughtless, selfish extravagance, and break your mother&rsquo;s
heart and mine by your drunkenness and folly, that you
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words, uttered in a tone of passionate bitterness, were
spoken by Mr Rothwell to his son in the hall at &ldquo;The
Firs,&rdquo; as the young man was urging his father to grant him
a considerable sum to pay some pressing debts. At the same moment
Mr John Randolph came out of the drawing-room, and could not help
overhearing what was being said.</p>
<p>Mr Rothwell turned fiercely upon him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What right have <i>you</i>, sir, to be intruding on my
privacy?&rdquo; he cried, nettled at his rebuke having been
overheard by a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not conscious of being guilty of any
intrusion,&rdquo; said the other quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> intruding,&rdquo; cried Mark, glad to
vent his exasperation at his father&rsquo;s reproaches on
somebody, and specially glad of an opportunity of doing so on the
music-master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not need to make the complaint again
then,&rdquo; said Mr Randolph, calmly, &ldquo;my lessons to your
sisters will cease from to-day;&rdquo; and with a stiff bow he
closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>Rather more than two years had elapsed since Jim Forbes&rsquo;
enlistment when the scene just described took place. Mark had
been sinking deeper and deeper in the mire; he was scarcely ever
sober except when visiting the Franklins, on which occasions he
was always on his guard, though his excited manner, and the
eagerness with which he tossed down the few glasses of wine to
which he, evidently with difficulty, restricted himself, made a
most painful impression not only <i>on</i> Mrs Franklin, but also
on her daughter.</p>
<p>Mary was now nineteen, and shone with the brightness which the
gentle light of holiness casts on every word and feature. She was
full of innocent cheerfulness, and was the joy of all who knew
her. Mark loved her as much as he could love anything that was
not himself, and tried to make himself acceptable to her. Mary
<i>hoped</i> the best about him, but that hope had begun to droop
for some time past. He had never yet ventured to declare his
affection to her; somehow or other he could not. A little spark
of nobleness still remained in him unquenched by the drink, and
it lighted him to see that to bind Mary to himself for life would
be to tie her to a living firebrand that would scorch and shrivel
up beauty, health and peace. He dared not speak: before her
unsullied loveliness his drink-envenomed lips were closed: he
could rattle on in wild exuberance of spirits, but he could not
yet venture to ask her to be his. And she? She pitied him deeply,
and her heart&rsquo;s affections hovered over him; would they
settle there? If so, lost! Lost! All peace would be lost: how
great her peril!</p>
<p>Another visit from Mr Tankardew: the old man had been a
frequent caller, and was ever welcome. That he cherished a
fatherly love for Mary was evident; indeed his heart seemed
divided between herself and the young musician, Mr John Randolph,
who, though he had ceased to give lessons at &ldquo;The
Firs,&rdquo; was most scrupulously punctual in his attendance at
&ldquo;The Shrubbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a bright summer&rsquo;s morning as the old man sat in
the drawing-room where Mary and her mother were engaged in the
mysteries of the needle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hear your last piece, my child,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;John tells me that he will soon have nothing more to teach
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary sat down and played with loving grace, till the old man
bowed his head upon his hands and wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Home, sweet home!&rsquo;&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Ay; you have played that lovely air with variations as if
you felt it: you know what a sweet home is, Mary; I knew it once.
&lsquo;Home, sweet home!&rsquo;&rdquo; he added again, with a
sigh.</p>
<p>There was a pause: then he went on: &ldquo;There are plenty of
homes that aren&rsquo;t sweet; homes with variations enough and
to spare in them; but they&rsquo;re variations of misery. I hope
you&rsquo;ll never have one of those homes, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary coloured deeply, and her mother&rsquo;s eyes filled with
tears. Mr Tankardew looked earnestly at them both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of any but sweet variations
<i>here</i>,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but all new homes are not
sweet homes&mdash;there&rsquo;s no sweetness that will last where
the barrel, the bottle, and the spirit-flask play a trio of
discords: they&rsquo;ll drown all the harmonies of harp and
piano. Promise me two things, my child;&rdquo; he added,
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; asked Mary, timidly and
tearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just these: promise me to become a pledged abstainer;
and promise me that you&rsquo;ll never marry a man that loves the
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Mary burst into tears, but her mother came to her aid,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see what good Mary&rsquo;s signing
the pledge will do. She has taken neither beer nor wine for some
time past, so that she does all that is needed in the way of
example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she does not, madam, if you&rsquo;ll excuse my
being so blunt. She just does not do what will make her example
<i>tell</i>. Power for good comes through combination; the devil
knows it well enough, and he gets drunkards to band together in
clubs; and worldly people band together in clubs, and back one
another up and concentrate their forces. All who see the curse
and misery of the drink should sign, and not stand apart as
solitary abstainers; they won&rsquo;t do the same good; it is by
uniting together that the great work is done by God&rsquo;s
blessing. A body of Christian abstainers united in the same work,
and bound by the same pledge, attract others, and give them
something to lean on and cling to: and that is one reason why we
want children to combine in Bands of Hope. Why, I&rsquo;ve seen a
man light a fire with a piece of glass, but how did he do it? Not
by putting the fuel under one ray of the sun; not by carrying it
about from place to place in the sunshine; but by gathering, with
the help of the glass, all the little rays together into one hot
bright focus. And so we want to gather together the power and
influence of total abstainers in Total Abstinence Societies and
Bands of Hope, by their union through the pledge as a common
bond. We want to set hearts on fire with a holy love that shall
make them burn to rescue poor slaves of the drink from their
misery and ruin. Won&rsquo;t you help? Can you hold back? Are not
souls perishing by millions through the drink, and is any
sacrifice too dear to make, any cross too heavy to take up in
such a cause?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man had risen, and was walking up and down the room
with great swinging strides. Then he stopped abruptly and waited
for an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mrs Franklin, &ldquo;we
would both sign if it could do any real good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>will</i> do good, it <i>must</i> do good: sign
now;&rdquo; he produced a pledge-book: &ldquo;no time like the
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The signatures were made, and then Mr Tankardew, clasping his
thin hands together, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, offered a
short emphatic prayer that God would bless and strengthen these
His servants, and enable them by His grace to be a blessing to
others as pledged abstainers. And then he turned again to Mary,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have given me the one promise; will you give me the
other? Will you promise me that you will never knowingly marry a
man who loves the drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary buried her face in her hands. A few moments, and no one
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, my child,&rdquo; cried the old man, again
beginning to pace the room with measured strides; &ldquo;you are
dear to me, very dear, for you&rsquo;re the image of one lost to
me years ago, long weary years ago. I cannot bear to see you
offered as another victim on the altar of the Drink-Moloch: he
has had victims enough: too many, too many. Do you wish to wither
into a premature grave? Do you wish to see the light die out of
your mother&rsquo;s smile? Then marry a drink-worshipper. Do you
wish to tremble every time you hear the footstep of the man who
has turned &lsquo;sweet home&rsquo; into a shuddering prison?
then marry a drink-worshipper. Do you wish to see little children
hide the terror of their eyes in your lap and tremble at the name
of father? Then marry a drink-worshipper. Stay, stay, I&rsquo;m
an old fool to break out in this way, and scare you out of your
wits;&rdquo; for Mary and her mother were both sobbing bitterly:
&ldquo;forgive me, but don&rsquo;t forget me; there, let us
change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mary had checked her sobs, and, rising up calm and
beautiful in her tears, she laid her hand lovingly on the old
man&rsquo;s arm, and said, gently but firmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old friend, thank you for what you have said. I
promise you that never will I knowingly marry one who loves
intoxicating drinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, my child. You have taken a load off the
old man&rsquo;s heart, and off your mother&rsquo;s too, I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would Mary keep her word? She was soon to be put to the test.
Though Mark hesitated to propose to Mary Franklin, his mother had
no scruples on the subject. He had now come to man&rsquo;s
estate, and she wished him to marry; specially she wished him to
marry Mrs Franklin&rsquo;s daughter, as Mary would enjoy a nice
little income when she came of age, and Mark&rsquo;s prospects
were cloudy enough as far as anything from his father was
concerned. Besides, she hoped that marrying Mary would steady her
son&mdash;a favourite scheme with mothers of drunkards. As for
Mary&rsquo;s own peace or happiness, she never gave them a
thought. The experiment would be something like caging a tiger
and a lamb together for the purpose of subduing the tiger&rsquo;s
ferocity; pleasant enough for the tiger, but simply destruction
to the lamb. However, Mrs Rothwell pressed Mark to propose, so he
yielded after a faint resistance, and now watched for his
opportunity.</p>
<p>It was a sweet July evening: the sun was near his setting, and
was casting long shadows across the lawn at the back of
&ldquo;The Shrubbery.&rdquo; Mrs Franklin was sitting on a garden
seat reading, her attention divided between her book and the
glowing tints of a bed of flowers all ablaze with variegated
beauty. A little shaded walk turned off near this seat into the
kitchen garden, which was separated from the flower garden in
this quarter by a deep ravine, at the bottom of which ran a trout
stream. The ravine was crossed by a rustic bridge. Mr John
Randolph had been calling at the house with some music, and,
being now looked upon more in the light of a friend than an
instructor, had the privilege of making a short cut to the
turnpike road over this foot bridge and through the kitchen
garden. Mark Rothwell also usually availed himself of this more
direct approach to the house. On the present occasion the two
young men met in the kitchen garden, and passed each other by
without recognition, Mark hurrying forward to make his proposal,
his already intense excitement inflamed by strong drink, which he
had taken with less caution than on his ordinary visits to
&ldquo;The Shrubbery&rdquo;; John Randolph lingering on his way
in a somewhat discontented mood, which was not improved by the
sight of Mark. Suddenly the stillness was broken by a loud scream
and cry for help: it was Mary Franklin&rsquo;s voice. Both the
young men rushed towards the bridge, and beheld a sight which
filled them with dismay. Mary had strolled from her
mother&rsquo;s side to the little foot bridge, and, filled with
sorrowful thoughts, leant against the rustic parapet. The
woodwork, which was inwardly decayed, gave way beneath her
weight; she tried to recover herself but in vain, and fell over
the side of the bridge, still, however, managing to keep herself
from plunging into the stream by clinging to a creaking fragment
of the broken rails. Her dress also helped to stay her up, having
become entangled with the woodwork. Mark reached the bridge
first, but was so confused by drink and excitement that he
scarcely knew what he was doing, when he felt himself flung aside
by the strong arm of John Randolph, who sprang forward, and
stooping down endeavoured to raise the poor terrified girl, but
for a few moments without success: indeed his own strength began
to fail, and it seemed as if both must be precipitated into the
stream, if assistance had not come from another quarter.
<img src="images/nlost103.jpg" alt="" /> The gardener hearing the
cries hurried up, and, lending his powerful help, Mary was
delivered from her peril, and was carried, fainting and bruised,
into the house by her two rescuers, before Mark Rothwell had
fairly recovered himself from the fall which John Randolph had
given him in his haste. But now, boiling with wrath and vexation,
Mark made his way to the front door, and disregarding in the
blindness of his passion the sight of Mary just recovering
consciousness, and of Mrs Franklin who was bending over her in
mingled grief and thankfulness, he turned furiously upon John,
who was just retiring, and shaking his fist in his face, cried
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you interfere with me, sir? I&rsquo;ll not put
up with this insolence from my sisters&rsquo; discarded
music-master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face of the other flushed crimson for a moment, then with
unruffled voice he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, Mr Mark, to be a master of music and of
one&rsquo;s self, than a slave of the drink. I wish you good
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Chapter Nine.</h3>
<h4>The Crisis.</h4>
<p>Several weeks had passed by after the accident and timely
rescue, weeks of anxious watching and tender nursing, before Mary
Franklin was sufficiently recovered from the shock and injuries
she had received to appear again among her friends. Many had been
the inquiries made by Mark and Mr Tankardew, and once or twice by
John Randolph.</p>
<p>It was on a calm Sabbath morning that mother and daughter
first walked beyond their own grounds, and made their way to the
little village church. Public thanks were offered that day for
Mary&rsquo;s wonderful preservation, and many a loving eye looked
through tears at the pale, serene face of her who had been so
mercifully rescued. Was Mark Rothwell there?&mdash;no; but there
was one who could not help gazing for a few moments, with a
deeper sentiment than admiring pity, at the fair young girl, as
the words of holy praise &ldquo;for the late mercies vouchsafed
unto her&rdquo; were uttered by the minister: it was John
Randolph. They met after service at the gate of the churchyard,
and the young man having expressed his heartfelt congratulations,
after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation offered Mary his arm, which she
gently declined. A slight shade of mingled shame, sadness, and
annoyance clouded his face for a moment, and as quickly passed
away. Mary was struggling to say something to him expressive of
her gratitude, but before she could put it into shape he was
gone.</p>
<p>The next day brought Mr Tankardew to &ldquo;The
Shrubbery.&rdquo; The old man drew Mary to him in the fulness of
his heart, and blessed her, calling her his child. &ldquo;Well,
what have the doctors made of you?&rdquo; he asked, rather
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made of me?&rdquo; asked Mary, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, made of you, they never could make anything
<i>of</i> me or <i>by</i> me; but what have they made of
<i>you</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You puzzle me,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they put labels on all their physic
bottles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; interposed Mrs Franklin,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful to say that our doctor has prescribed
little else than rest and tonics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were the tonics labelled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I understand you now. Mary has not broken her
pledge, she would take no wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent girl! Of course she was ordered
wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes; and ale or porter too. The doctor almost
insisted on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he did; they always do. Ah! Well! Brave girl!
You said no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I felt convinced that I should do as well without
beer or wine, and I have had no cause to regret that I did not
take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! You&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> regret it. You must
help us to fight the doctors: they mean well, some of them; but
most of them are building up the palace of intemperance faster
than we can pull it down. &lsquo;The doctor ordered it;&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s an excuse with thousands to drown their souls in
drink. I wonder if they&rsquo;d swallow a shovelful of red hot
coals if the doctor ordered it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Summer had now given place to autumn; it was a bright
September day when the above conversation took place. When Mr
Tankardew rose to go, Mrs Franklin and Mary volunteered to
accompany him a little way. So they went forth, and a sweet and
pleasant sight it was, the hale, grey-haired veteran still full
of fire, yet checking his steps to keep pace with the young
girl&rsquo;s feebler tread: she, all gentleness and sober
gladness, and her mother happy in the abiding trust of a
believing heart.</p>
<p>They passed out of the grounds across a lane thickly shaded by
trees, whose foliage was beginning to change its summer hue for
the gorgeous varieties of autumnal colouring. Then they followed
a winding path that skirted a wide sea of wheat, which rose and
fell in rustling waves, disclosing now and again bright dazzling
gleams of the scarlet poppy. At the end of this field was a stile
leading into the highroad to Hopeworth. Here they paused, and
were just about to part, when the sound of a horse&rsquo;s feet
in rapid but very irregular motion arrested their attention. The
animal and his rider soon came into view, the latter evidently
keeping his seat with difficulty. There was plainly a struggle of
some kind going on between the brute and the <i>rational</i>
being who was mounted on him, and while drawing the reins tight
with one hand, was belabouring the poor creature about the head
most unmercifully with a heavy hunting whip. The horse not
appreciating the advantages of this treatment at the hands of its
<i>intellectual</i> owner, was resisting by a shuffling,
remonstrating sort of gallop; while his rider, who was evidently
a practised horseman, seemed to stick to his saddle by a kind of
instinct, having little else to guide him, for his hat was
completely shaken down over his eyes.</p>
<p>Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s indignation was kindled in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wretch! The drunken beast!&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;serve him right if his horse pitches him head foremost
into the first ditch with any dirty water in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On came the contending pair, the man swaying from side to
side, but nevertheless marvellously retaining his seat. At the
sight of the <img src="images/nlost109.jpg" alt="" /> ladies, or
at a sudden movement forward of Mr Tankardew, the animal swerved
and almost unseated his tormentor, who, however, recovered
himself, but in doing so lost his hat, as the poor beast again
plunged forward with his almost unconscious burden. The horseman
took no notice of his loss, nor did he see who were the
spectators of his sinful degradation, but to them he was fully
revealed: it was Mark Rothwell. Another minute and he was out of
sight.</p>
<p>Mary sank, with a bitter cry, into her mother&rsquo;s arms,
while Mr Tankardew sprang forward to support them both. In a
moment or two, however, the ladies had recovered themselves, and
turned homewards. The old man saw that they would prefer to be
alone, so, with a kind and courteous farewell, he made his way
with slow strides towards the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he muttered to himself;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Good entertainment for man and beast,&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s what they put over some of these alcohol shops.
I&rsquo;d like to know which was the beast just now.
Entertainment! Ay, very entertaining, such a sight to the devil
and his angels. O miserable drink! Haven&rsquo;t you drowned
souls enough yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two days after this disgraceful exposure of himself, Mark
Rothwell made an early call at &ldquo;The Shrubbery.&rdquo; He
was utterly ignorant of his having been seen in his drunkenness
by Mrs Franklin and her daughter, and was scrupulously sober on
the present occasion, and full of good resolutions, as habitual
drunkards very commonly are after an outbreak of more than usual
violence. He was quite convinced&mdash;at least he was enjoying a
good deal of cheerful self-congratulation on the supposed
conviction&mdash;that he never would exceed again; so in the
strength of this conviction, he entered the room where Mary and
her mother were sitting, with a confident step, though he could
not quite keep down every feeling of misgiving. Still, it never
occurred to him that Mary could possibly refuse him. He had too
high an opinion of himself: he was such a general favourite and
so popular, that he felt sure any young lady of his acquaintance
would esteem herself honoured by the offer of his hand. He was
well aware, it is true, that Mary had a horror of drunkenness;
but he flattered himself, first, that he could persuade her that
he meant to be sober for the future, and a total abstainer too if
she required it; and then, that he had got a sufficient hold upon
her heart, or at any rate regard, to make her willing to accept
him without any stipulations rather than lose him. Strong in
these impressions, he had now come over to make a formal
proposal. The manner, however, of mother and daughter disturbed
him; something he saw was amiss; there was a sadness and
constraint in the words of both which distressed and embarrassed
him. After a brief conversation on commonplace topics Mary rose
hastily and left the room. Mark hesitated, but feeling that he
must seize the opportunity, he at once asked Mrs Franklin&rsquo;s
permission to avow his attachment to her daughter.</p>
<p>A long and painful pause: broken, at last, by Mrs
Franklin&rsquo;s reply, that she could not advise her daughter to
encourage his addresses.</p>
<p>Mark was thunderstruck! For several minutes surprise and
mortification kept him silent. At last he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what does Mary wish herself? We&rsquo;ve known each
other so long; she knows I love her, she must know it. I&rsquo;m
sure she would not refuse me; may I not see her? May I not have
&lsquo;yes,&rsquo; or &lsquo;no,&rsquo; from her own
lips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will ask her,&rdquo; was the reply; and poor Mark was
left for half an hour to his own not very agreeable reflections.
At the end of that time Mrs Franklin returned, with a sealed
letter in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary does not feel equal to seeing you now,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and indeed I could not recommend her doing so at
present. She sends you this letter instead; do not read it
now,&rdquo; for Mark was tearing it open, &ldquo;but wait till
you can give it your calm and full attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark would have remonstrated, but Mrs Franklin&rsquo;s quiet
decision restrained him; he flung himself out of the house, and
on reaching the highway, burst open the envelope and read as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mark,&mdash;We have always been friends, and I
hope shall remain so; but we can never be anything more to one
another. I have solemnly resolved in God&rsquo;s sight that I
will never marry a drunkard, and I never will. I was witness to
your ill-usage of your poor horse the other day, when you were
intoxicated; I cannot forget it; my mind is made up, I cannot
alter it, and my dear mother entirely approves of my decision. I
thank you for your offer, and pray that you may have grace given
you to forsake the sin which has made it impossible that there
can ever be more than a feeling of sincere interest and
kindliness towards yourself, from yours truly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Franklin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark Rothwell tore the letter, when he had glanced through it,
into bits, dashed them on the ground, and, with loud
imprecations, stamped on them. There was a fire in his heart, a
mad desire for revenge; he was, what drunkards must be,
essentially selfish. Wounded vanity, disappointed affection,
bitter jealousy, were the fuel to that fire. He had no thought
now of remonstrance with Mary: he had no <i>wish</i> to
remonstrate: his one great burning desire was to be revenged. He
rushed home, but found little to cheer him there. For months past
a cloud had hung over &ldquo;The Firs,&rdquo; which had become
denser and darker every day. And now it was come abroad that Mr
Rothwell was bankrupt. It was too true: the reckless expenditure
of Mark, and the incautious good nature of Mr Rothwell, which had
led him, under the influence of free living, to engage in
disastrous speculations, had brought ruin on the miserable
family. A few more weeks and &ldquo;The Firs&rdquo; was
untenanted.</p>
<p>But, in the midst of all this darkness, there shone forth a
ray of heavenly light.</p>
<p>It was near midnight of the day when the sale of Mr
Rothwell&rsquo;s effects had taken place at &ldquo;The
Firs.&rdquo; A candle twinkled still in the cottage of Mrs
Forbes, for there was work to be sent home early on the morrow,
and neither lateness nor weariness might suspend their anxious
toil. Lame Sally and her mother had been talking over, what was
in everyone&rsquo;s mouth and thoughts, the sad downfall of the
Rothwells. They saw God&rsquo;s hand in it, but they did not
rejoice; they had found their Saviour true to His word, and
enjoyed a peace in casting their care on Him which they knew all
the wealth of the world could not have given them. Only one thing
they still prayed for which the Lord had not yet granted: Jim,
poor Jim! But what was that? A footstep: how their hearts beat!
Could it be the old familiar tread? Yes; Jim, but no longer
drunken, gambling, prodigal Jim, was next moment at his
mother&rsquo;s feet, and a minute after with his arms round his
sister&rsquo;s neck. And there was weeping, but not for sorrow,
in that cottage, and there was joy before the angels of heaven
over a repentant sinner. Jim was come back. A mother&rsquo;s and
sister&rsquo;s prayers had reached him and drawn him home. He was
sober now: he was a pledged abstainer: he had brought his pay in
his hand and love in his heart; and that night, while the shadows
lay thick around the deserted mansion of &ldquo;The Firs,&rdquo;
and not even the wail of sorrow broke the stillness, there was
light and music and peace in that humble cottage; the light of
love, the music of thanksgiving, and &ldquo;the peace of God
which passeth understanding.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Chapter Ten.</h3>
<h4>Desperate Doings.</h4>
<p>It is not to be supposed that Mary Franklin could mourn very
deeply the departure of Mark Rothwell. Recent events had worn out
the old impressions of tenderness. All that was bright and
attractive in Mark had melted away before the scorching,
withering flame of alcohol. She had heard his cruel taunts to her
preserver on the evening of her rescue; she had seen him
shamefully intoxicated when ill-using his poor horse. Could she
cherish love or tenderness for such a being as this? Impossible!
She was thankful to forget him. O misery! Why do so many of the
good and noble frown upon those who would keep the intoxicating
cup altogether out of the hands of the young? What do the young
lose by never tasting it? Not health, not cheerfulness, not
self-respect, not self-control. No! And what do they gain by
tasting? Too often, habits of ruinous self-indulgence; too often
a thirst which grows with years; too often a withered manhood or
womanhood, and a decrepit and dishonoured old age.</p>
<p>October was drawing to its close: nothing had been heard of
the Rothwells, and their old dwelling was now occupied by another
tenant. John Randolph&rsquo;s visits to &ldquo;The
Shrubbery&rdquo; began to be more frequent, and were certainly
not unacceptable. Gratitude to him for her rescue forbade
Mary&rsquo;s repelling him; and, indeed, the more she and her
mother came to know him, the more they learnt to value his manly
and Christian character. They began likewise to perceive that he
was more than he seemed to be. Mr Tankardew had given them to
understand latterly that he was their equal both in birth and
fortune. A mystery there was about him, it was true; but the veil
was now getting so thin that they could both see pretty
distinctly through it, but were content to wait for the proper
time of its withdrawal. And so it was felt by all that, in time,
John Randolph and Mary Franklin would be drawn together by a
closer bond than that of esteem and respect, but no one as yet
gave outspoken expression to this conviction.</p>
<p>Things were thus hanging in no unpleasing suspense, when, in
the twilight of an October evening, two men of rather suspicious
appearance might have been seen climbing the paling <i>fence</i>
at the back of &ldquo;The Shrubbery.&rdquo; Scarcely had one of
them reached the top, when a third person approached, at first
hastily; then he suddenly checked himself, and cautiously crept
along, so as to keep himself out of the sight of the two others
who were climbing into the grounds. This third person was John
Randolph, who had lately left &ldquo;The Shrubbery,&rdquo; and
had come round by the road at the back, to call, by Mrs
Franklin&rsquo;s request, on a poor sick cottager in the village.
The road in this part was lonely, and the trespassers evidently
imagined themselves unobserved. The first who scaled the palings
was a stoutish, middle-aged man: but who was the other?
Randolph&rsquo;s heart beat violently with a terrible suspicion.
Did he know this second figure? He could not be quite sure, for
he was afraid to approach too near; but he was almost convinced
that he had seen him before. When fairly over the fence, both men
crept along as quietly as possible under the shelter of a large
bank of evergreens. He who had climbed over last led the way, and
was plainly well acquainted with the grounds; he was a much
younger man than his companion, and seemed scarcely sober, yet
without having lost self-possession and the knowledge of what he
was doing. John waited till they were fairly out of hearing, and
then himself rapidly and noiselessly followed them towards the
house under cover of the laurels. It was now getting very dusk,
but he could manage to track them till they had reached some
outhouses, along the wall of which they crawled, crouching down.
And now they had arrived at the rear of the house, and stood in
shadow opposite a back passage window. Randolph crept silently up
and squeezed himself behind a huge water-butt, where he was
perfectly concealed, and could overhear part of the conversation
now hurriedly held between the two burglars, if such they
were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure the man does not sleep in the
house?&rdquo; asked the elder man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied the second, in a husky whisper.
John Randolph felt pretty certain that he knew the voice, but he
hardly dared think it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the plate chest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know: most likely in the pantry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John was now confident that he knew the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; whispered the elder man, fiercely,
&ldquo;this passage window &rsquo;ll do: it won&rsquo;t take much
to prise it open: you&rsquo;ll look after the women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust <i>me</i> for that,&rdquo; muttered the other;
and Randolph thought he heard a click, as of the cocking of a
pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, you fool!&rdquo; growled the older burglar, with
an oath: then there was a few moments&rsquo; silence, and the two
crept back. They sat down under the shelter of some large shrubs,
with their backs to John, who could only just make them out from
his hiding-place, for it was now getting quite dark. A little
while, and they rose, and passed very near their unsuspected
watcher, who could just catch the words &ldquo;Two
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; as they made their way back to the fence. A
few moments more, and they were clear of the grounds.</p>
<p>John Randolph&rsquo;s mind was made up in a moment what to do.
Having cautiously followed the two men into the road, and
ascertained that they were not lurking anywhere about &ldquo;The
Shrubbery,&rdquo; he hurried off at once to Hopeworth, and
communicated what he had seen and heard to the police. He was
very anxious that no unnecessary alarm should be given to Mrs
Franklin or Mary, and that they should be kept, if possible, in
ignorance of the whole matter till the danger was over; so he
resolved to accompany the constables, who, with the
superintendent, were preparing to encounter the housebreakers. It
was presumed, from what he had overheard, that an attempt was to
be made on &ldquo;The Shrubbery&rdquo; that very night, and that
the two men seen by John Randolph were only part of a larger
gang. Help was therefore procured, and about one o&rsquo;clock a
party of a dozen, including John, all disguised in
labourers&rsquo; clothes, had noiselessly scaled the fence in
different parts by two and two, and, recognising one another by a
password previously agreed upon, were soon clustered together
under some dense shrubs not far from the passage window before
mentioned. It was a tranquil morning, but very cloudy. All was
deep stillness in the house. Little did Mrs Franklin and her
daughter think, as they read together before parting for the
night those comforting words, &ldquo;The angel of the Lord
encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth
them,&rdquo; that such foes and such protectors were so close at
hand. But they laid them down in perfect peace, and their
heavenly Father&rsquo;s loving power was as a wall of fire about
them. Patiently did the watchers listen from their hiding-place
to every sound. Two o&rsquo;clock, at last, rang out clear from
the great timepiece on the stairs; they could hear it distinctly
outside. What was that sound? Only the distant barking of a fox.
But now there are other sounds. One, two, three, at length six
men in all have crept to the part of the yard opposite the back
door. All paused and looked carefully round: everything seemed
safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said one who appeared to be a leader,
&ldquo;it does not seem as if we need be over particular:
there&rsquo;s neither dog nor man about, and the women
won&rsquo;t <i>do</i> much. Where&rsquo;s the crowbar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at this moment a bright ray of light flashed out along
the passage, and a female figure could be seen crossing the
landing. The housebreakers shrunk back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not do,&rdquo; said the leader, half aloud;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got scent of us somehow: pr&rsquo;aps
they&rsquo;ve some men inside to help them, we&rsquo;d better be
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fools! Cowards!&rdquo; exclaimed a younger man, in a
fierce whisper, as the others began to slink away; &ldquo;are you
afraid of a parcel of women? But I&rsquo;ll not be baffled:
she&rsquo;s there:&rdquo; and he raised a pistol, and pointed it
towards the figure which had descended close to the passage
window with the light in her hand, and was trying to peer into
the darkness outside. His companion pulled down his arm with a
savage imprecation. All was still for a few minutes, and the
female retired to the landing and then disappeared. The burglars
hesitated, when, just at the moment of their indecision, one of
the police imitated the low growling of a dog close at hand.
Instantly the whole gang took to their heels, closely followed by
the constables. No shout had been raised, no word had been
spoken, for John Randolph had been most anxious that the thieves
should be captured without alarming the ladies. And now in the
darkness, pursuers and pursued were scattered in different
directions. John sprang after the young man who had raised the
pistol, and succeeded in grappling with him before he could mount
the fence. The clouds were now dispersed, and there was light
enough for one to recognise another. Randolph could not doubt;
the intended murderer was Mark Rothwell. Fiercely did the two
young men strive together, and at last both fell, Mark undermost;
and, relaxing <img src="images/nlost123.jpg" alt="" /> his hold,
John was rising to his feet, when the other drew a pistol, but
before he could fire his adversary had turned it aside; it went
off, wounding the unhappy young man who held it. Randolph drew
back in dismay, hearing the injured man&rsquo;s involuntary
groan, but in another instant Mark had drawn a second pistol and
fired. The ball grazed the other&rsquo;s forehead, and he
staggered back stupefied. When he recovered himself Mark had
disappeared, and never from that night was heard of or seen in
Hopeworth or its neighbourhood. Near the part of the fence where
the scuffle took place were afterwards found marks of a
horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and traces of blood. The miserable young man
contrived to get clear away: the rest of the gang were all
captured by the police.</p>
<p>The day after this adventure old Mr Tankardew and John
Randolph paid a visit together to &ldquo;The Shrubbery.&rdquo; Of
course the wildest tales were in circulation, the central point
in most being the murder of Mrs Franklin and her daughter.
&ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; said the old man to Mary and her mother,
&ldquo;that you have suffered nothing but a little fright.
All&rsquo;s well that ends well, and I&rsquo;m thankful that my
young friend here was able to be of some service; you see, God
can take care of His own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been so, indeed,&rdquo; replied Mrs Franklin;
&ldquo;Mary could not sleep, she cannot tell why; she felt
restless and uneasy, and just about two o&rsquo;clock she was
crossing to my room, when she thought she heard some unusual
sounds in the yard. She looked out of the passage window, but
could see nothing; then she heard a sort of scuffle, and, after
that, all was still; and, though we were rather alarmed, we heard
nothing more. But this morning has brought us strange tidings,
and I find that we are again indebted to our kind young friend
here for help in time of need, and that, too, I fear, at his own
imminent risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention this,&rdquo; said the young man;
&ldquo;it has been a privilege to me to have been able to render
this assistance. I am only too thankful that I was put in the way
of discovering what might have otherwise been a very serious
business. But we must see that you are better protected for the
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true, John,&rdquo; interrupted Mr Tankardew,
smiling; &ldquo;I see I must put in a word. My dear child, Miss
Franklin seems more willing than able to speak just now. Yes; let
me make a clean breast of it. Let me introduce our young friend
in a new character, John Randolph Tankardew, my only son, my only
surviving child.&rdquo; His voice trembled, and then he added,
&ldquo;He has twice been the protector of my dear adopted
daughter, let me join their hands together as a pledge that he
may shortly obtain a better title to be her protector while life
shall last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, placing the half-shrinking hand of Mary in the young
man&rsquo;s stronger grasp, he held them together with a fervent
blessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he added, as they sat in a loving
group, too full of tearful peace to wish to break the charmed
silence by hasty words, &ldquo;now let me tell my story, and
unravel the little tangle which has made me a mystery to my
neighbours, and a burden to my friends. But all that is past;
there are brighter days before us now.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Chapter Eleven.</h3>
<h4>Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s Story Begun.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;You must know, dear friends,&rdquo; began the old man
sadly, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m a wiser man now than I was once. Not
that there&rsquo;s much wisdom to boast of now; only I have
learnt by experience, and he is a sharp schoolmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born to trust others; it was misery to me to live
in distrust and suspicion; I couldn&rsquo;t do it. People told me
I was a fool; it was true, I knew it, but I went on trusting.
David said in his haste, &lsquo;all men are liars.&rsquo; I said
in my haste, or rather my folly, &lsquo;all men are true.&rsquo;
They might lie to others, but I thought they couldn&rsquo;t, or
wouldn&rsquo;t, or didn&rsquo;t lie to me. At any rate I&rsquo;d
trust them; it was so sad to think that a being made in
God&rsquo;s image could go about wilfully deceiving others.
I&rsquo;d take a brighter view of my fellow-men and women. I
never could abide your shrewd, knowing people, who seemed to be
always living with a wink in their eyes, and a grin on their
lips, as if they believed in nobody and nothing but their own
sharpness. I loathed them, and I loathe them still. But I
wasn&rsquo;t wise. I had to smart for it. I had plenty of money
when I came of age, and I had plenty of friends, or rather
acquaintances, who knew it. But I was shy, and not over fond of
many companions; my weakness wasn&rsquo;t in that direction. I
had sense enough to see through your common gold-hunters. I was
never over fond of sugar-candy; coarse flattery made me sick, and
I had no taste for patching up the holes in the purses of
profligates and spendthrifts. I never was a worshipper of money,
but I knew its value, and wasn&rsquo;t disposed to make ducks and
drakes of it, nor partridges and pheasants either. So the summer
flies, after buzzing about me a little, flew off to sunnier
spots; all except one. He puzzled me a bit at first, but I blamed
myself for having a shadow of suspicion of him. All seemed so
open about him, open hands, open eyes, open brow; he wound
himself round my heart before I knew where I was. Mine was a fair
estate (it will be yours one day, Mary, my child, I trust;
John&rsquo;s and yours together). I&rsquo;d lived away from home
many years before I came into it, for both my parents died while
I was young, and when I came of age, my nearest relations were
only distant. I never had brother nor sister. When I came to
reside on my property the neighbours called, and I returned their
calls, and it didn&rsquo;t go much beyond that. They thought me
cold and unfeeling, but they were mistaken. But I must go back
and take up my dropped thread. I said there was one man who got
hold of my heart. I had a good stout fence of prejudices, and an
inner paling of reserve about that heart of mine, but he
contrived to climb over both, and get inside. I could have done
anything for him, but he did not seem to want anything but my
affection; so I thought. He had a sister: well, what shall I say?
I&rsquo;m a poor, weak, old fool; it is all past and gone now. I
must go straight on; but it is like ploughing up my heart into a
thousand deep furrows with my own hand. But; well, he had a
sister; I&rsquo;ll not tell you her name, nor his either: at
least not now. He brought her with him to call on me one day. She
had never been in the neighbourhood before, for her brother was
only a recent settler in the place. I was charmed with her; the
more so because she was so like her brother, so bright and so
open; so thoroughly transparent. She beamed upon me like a flood
of sunshine, and gilded my cloudy reserve with her own radiance,
so that I shone out myself in her company; so they told me, and I
believed it. I was young then, you&rsquo;ll remember. I
wasn&rsquo;t the wrinkled old pilgrim that I am now. We got
attached to one another, it would seem, at once; others may
<i>fall</i> in love; <i>we leapt</i> into it; I never thought to
ask myself whether she loved God. I was content to know that she
loved <i>me</i>. I was aware that I had a heart, but at that time
I hadn&rsquo;t learnt that I had a soul. Well, my friend (shall I
drop the &lsquo;r,&rsquo; and call him &lsquo;fiend&rsquo;?
&rsquo;Twould be truer); he did all he could to hasten on our
marriage. He did it very quietly, so openly, too. He was so
radiant with joy at the thoughts of my coming happiness.
&lsquo;She was such a sister,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;she would be
such a wife to me.&rsquo; I never had any misgivings but once,
and then the shadow was but as the passing of a white cloud
before summer&rsquo;s noonday sunshine. I was going from home for
a week, but unexpected business detained me for another day. I
walked over to my future brother-in-law&rsquo;s in the afternoon.
It was summer time. I went in, as was my habit, by the garden
door, and was crossing the lawn, when I heard sounds of wild
laughter proceeding from a little summer-house; they were sounds
of boisterous and almost idiotic mirth. There was a duet of
merriment, in which a male and female each took a part. I hardly
knew what I was doing, or whether to go back or advance. As I
hesitated, all was hushed. I saw a female figure dart like
lightning into the house, and then my friend (I must call him so
for want of a better title) came forward, and holding out both
his hands to me, said &lsquo;Welcome, welcome, this is an
unexpected pleasure. I thought you were far away on your journey
before now; my sister and I have been almost dying with laughter
over a book lent to us by a friend. I do think I never read
anything so irresistibly ludicrous in all my life.&rsquo; I
hardly knew what to say in reply, I was so completely taken
aback. I was turning, however, towards the summer-house in which
I just caught a glance of a table with a bottle and glasses on
it, when my companion, catching my arm in his, hurried me away to
another part of the garden, where, he said, he was going to make
some improvements, about which he must have my judgment and
suggestions. As we afterwards went into the house, we again
passed the summer-house, but the glasses and bottle were gone. We
entered into one of the sitting-rooms, and the servant came to
tell us that her mistress had just been sent for to see a poor
sick cottager, who wanted her immediately. This led her brother
to break out into raptures about his sister&rsquo;s benevolence,
self-denial, and charity! Indeed, I never heard him so eloquent
on any subject before. I left, however, in a little while, for he
seemed unnaturally restless and excited during my stay, and a
cloud lowered upon me all the way home, but it had melted away by
the next morning. But I must hasten on. We were married soon
after this, and I settled a handsome allowance on my wife for her
own private use. She had no parents living, but had kept house
for another brother before she came to reside in our
neighbourhood. I wished to suppose myself happy as a married man,
but, somehow or other, I was not. My wife made large professions
of affection, but, spite of myself, I mistrusted them. Her
brother, too, seldom came now to see me, unless he had some
private business with his sister; and they were often closeted
together alone for an hour or more. Then she would come out to
me, radiant with smiles, and full of excitement; and her brother
would rattle on, hurrying from one topic to another, so as to
leave me no power to collect my thoughts, or shape any questions
which I was anxious to ask him. I am given to trust, as I have
told you, and ever shall be, if I live to be a dozen centuries
old. Still, I couldn&rsquo;t help having my doubts, my grievous
doubts. Well, one morning, my brother-in-law called; he seemed
agitated, and in much distress, saying that he must give up his
house and join his brother, with whom he was in partnership; as
he found his presence was required for the investigation, and, he
feared it might be, the winding-up of their affairs. I pitied
him, and offered him help. He refused it almost with indignation,
but I pressed it, and he accepted a loan, merely as a loan, he
said, of a thousand pounds, for which I gave him a cheque on the
spot. With tears in his eyes, and a warm pressure of the hand, he
was gone. I never saw him again. A <i>few</i> mornings after
this; it was about six months after we were married; my wife and
I were sitting at breakfast when she threw a paper to me across
the table, saying, &lsquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll see to
that.&rsquo; It was a bill for a considerable amount, contracted
by herself before our marriage, and for articles which were
certainly no part of a lady&rsquo;s toilet or wardrobe, nor could
be of any possible use to one of her sex. I was astonished; but
she treated the matter very coolly, or appeared to do so. When I
asked for an explanation, she avoided my eye, and turned the
matter off; and when I pressed her on the subject, she said,
&lsquo;Well, it is no use my entering into explanations now;
you&rsquo;ll find it all right.&rsquo; I was greatly disturbed,
for there was something in her manner that showed me she was ill
at ease, though she endeavoured to wear a nonchalant air. There
was a wild light, too, in her eyes, which distressed and almost
alarmed me, and a suspicion came over me which almost made me
faint. She left the breakfast table abruptly, and I saw no more
of her till luncheon time; but when I went to my library, I found
a packet on my table which I had not noticed there before. I
opened it; it was full of unpaid bills, all made out to my wife
in her maiden name, and most, indeed nearly all of them, for
articles unsuited for female use. A horrible suspicion flashed
across my mind. Could it possibly be that these were her
brother&rsquo;s debts: that he had got these articles in her
name, and had had the bills sent in to her? And could it be that
brother and sister had been in league together, and that he with
all his assumption of openness and candour and large-heartedness,
had entrapped me into this marriage that I might liquidate the
debts of an abandoned and reckless profligate? And could it be,
farther, (madden ing thought!) that the <i>whole</i> extravagance
was not his, and that numerous unpaid accounts for wine and
spirits were, partly, for what she had taken as well as her
brother? Then I thought of the scene in the garden, of the wild
laughter, of her sudden disappearance, of the signs of drinking
in the summer-house. Oh! My heart turned sick; was I tricked,
deceived, ruined in my peace for ever? I paced up and down my
library, more like a lunatic than a sane man. Luncheon time came:
we met: she threw herself into my arms, and wept and laughed and
implored; but I felt that a drunkard was embracing me, and I
flung her from me, and rushed out of the house. O misery! Whither
should I go, what should I do? It was all too true: her brother
was the basest of men: she did love <i>him</i>, I believe, it was
the only unselfish thing about her. Well, I had to go back home;
<i>home</i>! Vilest of names to me then! &lsquo;home,
<i>bitter</i> home!&rsquo; And yet I loved that poor guilty,
fallen creature. There was a terrible light in her eyes as we sat
opposite one another at dinner. We had to play a part before the
footman. Oh! What a dreadful meal that was! I seemed to be
feeding on ashes, and drinking wormwood. I felt as if every
morsel would choke me. We spoke to one another in measured terms.
Would the miserable farce of a dinner never be over? It came to
an end at last. And then she came to me trembling and penitent,
and, laying her head on my shoulder, wept till tears would fall
no longer. She was sober then; she had taken nothing but water at
dinner. She unburdened her heart to me (so I thought), and
confessed all. She told me how she and her brother had been
brought up, as children, in habits of self-indulgence, especially
in having free access to the wine and spirits. She told me that
she and her unworthy brother had been all in all to one another,
that gambling and drink had brought him into difficulties, and
that she had allowed him to run up accounts in her name. She
declared that he really loved and valued me, and that the thought
of hurrying on our marriage for any selfish object, was quite a
recent idea, suggested by distress under pecuniary embarrassment.
She asserted passionately that she truly loved me; she implored
me to overlook the past, and promised, with solemn appeal to
Heaven, that she would renounce the drink from that hour, and
give me no more uneasiness. Ay, she promised; a drunkard&rsquo;s
promise! Lighter than the lightest gossamer; brittle as the ice
of an April morning. I believed her: did she believe herself? I
fear not. But the worst was to come, the shadows were deepening,
the storm was gathering. A year had passed over our wedded life,
when a little girl was given to us. Every cord of my heart that
had been untwined or slackened of late wound itself fast round
that blessed little one.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Chapter Twelve.</h3>
<h4>Mr Tankardew&rsquo;s Story Finished.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;All was joy for a time. We called our little one Mary;
it was a name I loved. I had not lived as a total abstainer;
though, as I told you once, my mother, whom I can only recollect
as a widow, had banished all intoxicants from our table. But I
was young when she died, and I became, and continued for many
years a moderate drinker. But now when our little girl was born,
I had swept the house clear of all alcoholic drinks; we
hadn&rsquo;t a drop in the place from cellar to attics, so I
thought. And my wife agreed with me that our little one should
never know the taste of the strong drink. We had not many
friends, for I was shy and reserved still, and my home was my
world and society; at least I wished it to be so. Sometimes I
thought my wife strangely excited, it looked very like the old
misery, but she solemnly declared that she never tasted anything
intoxicating. I hoped she spoke the truth, even against the
evidence of my senses. After a while she persuaded me that I
wanted change, that I was rusting out in my loneliness. She would
have me accept an invitation to a friend&rsquo;s house now and
then: it would do me good. <i>She</i> was happy in her home, she
said, only she should be happier still if she could see me
gaining spirits by occasional intercourse with like-minded
friends. Not that she wished me to leave her; it was for my own
good she said it, and she should be delighting in the thoughts of
the good it would do me, and should find abundance to cheer her
in my absence, in the care of our darling child. She said all
this so openly, so artlessly, that I believed her. I thought she
might be right; so I went now and then from home for a few days,
and, by degrees, more and more frequently. And my wife encouraged
it. She said it did me so much good, and the benefit I reaped in
improved health, spirits, and intelligence quite reconciled her
to the separation. We went on so till our Mary was five years
old; I could not say that my wife was ever manifestly
intemperate, but painful suspicions hung like a black cloud over
me. At last one summer&rsquo;s day, one miserable day: I can
never forget it: I set out to pay a week&rsquo;s visit to a
friend, who lived some ten miles distant from my home. I drove
myself in a light, open carriage; my horse was young and rather
shy. I was just going round a bend in the road, when a boy jumped
suddenly over a hedge, right in front of us. Away went my horse
at the top of his speed, and soon landed me in a ditch, and broke
away, leaving the carriage with a fractured shaft behind him. I
was not hurt myself, so I got assistance from the nearest
cottage; and, having caught my horse, and found someone to whom I
could trust the repairing of my vehicle, I walked home. It was
afternoon when I arrived. I walked straight in through the back
of the premises, and entered the dining-room; there was no one
there. I was going to ring for one of the servants, when the door
opened, and little Mary toddled (I ought rather to say tottered)
up to me. Her mother was close behind her, but, at the sight of
me, she uttered a wild cry, shut the door violently, and rushed
upstairs. I had seen enough in her face: too much, too much! And
the little child, our darling little Mary, what was amiss with
her? Could it be? Had that cruel woman dared to do such a thing?
Yes: it was so indeed: the little child was under the influence
of strong drink; I drew the horrible truth from her by degrees.
The mother had taught that little babe to like the exciting cup;
she had sweetened and made it specially palatable. She had done
this to make the child a willing partaker in her sin, to bribe
her to secrecy, and to use her as a tool for the gratifying of
her own vile appetite. Thus was she deliberately poisoning the
body and soul of her child, and training her in deceit, that she
might league that little one, as she grew up, with herself in
procuring the forbidden stimulant, and in deceiving her own
father. O accursed drink, which can thus turn a mother into the
tempter and destroyer of her own guileless and unsuspecting
child! I rushed out of the room, and was about to hurry upstairs,
but I shrank back shivering and heart-sick. Then I went up slowly
and heavily: my bedroom door was bolted; so was the door of my
wife&rsquo;s dressing-room; I came downstairs again, and, taking
Mary by the hand, went into my library. There the storm of
trouble did its work, for it drove me down upon my knees. I
poured out my heart in strong crying to God; I owned that I had
lived without Him, and that I had not loved nor sought Him. I
prayed for pardon and a new heart, and that He would have mercy
on my poor wife and child. As I knelt in my agony of supplication
I felt two little hands placed on my own, then mine were gently
pulled from me, and my precious little child, looking up in my
face with streaming eyes, said, &lsquo;Papa, don&rsquo;t cry;
dear papa, don&rsquo;t cry. I <i>will</i> be a good girl.&rsquo;
I pressed her to my heart, and blessed God that it was not yet
too late. Before nightfall I had driven away with that dear
child, and had placed her with a valued friend whom I could
trust, one of the few who had ever visited at our house, a total
abstainer, and, better still, a devoted Christian. My child had
always loved her, and I felt that I could leave her in such hands
with the utmost confidence. But I had a home still, in name at
least, for all the sunshine had gone out of the word
&lsquo;home&rsquo; for me. I returned the next day to our
childless house: where was the mother? She lay on the floor of
her dressing-room, crushed in spirit to the dust. I raised her
up; she would not look at me, but hid her face in her hands; her
eyes were dry, she had wept away all her tears. I could not bear
her grief, and I tried to comfort her; all might yet be well.
Again she confessed all, her deceit, her heartlessness; but she
laid it to the drink. True, she was in this a self-deceiver, but
how terrible must be the power for evil in a stimulant which can
so utterly degrade the soul, cloud the intellect, and benumb the
conscience! Well, she poured forth a torrent of vows, promises,
and resolutions for the future. I bade her turn them into
prayers, but she did not understand me. However, there was peace
for awhile: our Mary came home again, and I watched her with an
unwearying carefulness. Another year brought us a son: he sits
among us now: John Randolph we call him. There was a sort of
truce till John was ten years old. I knew that my poor unhappy
wife still continued to obtain strong drink, but she did not take
it to excess to my knowledge, and it was never placed upon our
table. I was myself, at this time, practically a total abstainer,
but I had signed no pledge. I didn&rsquo;t see the use of it
then, so I had not got my children to sign. My poor wife
<i>professed</i> to take no alcoholic stimulants, yet I could not
but know that she was deceiving herself. She was, alas! Too
self-confident. She seemed to think that all danger of
<i>excess</i> was now over, and that a white lie about taking
none was no real harm, so long as it satisfied <i>me</i>; but it
neither deceived nor satisfied me. At last, one winter&rsquo;s
day, she proposed that John should drive her in her pony-carriage
to the neighbouring village, where there was an old servant of
ours who was ill, whom she wanted to see. The pony was a quiet
one, and was used to John&rsquo;s driving, so I did not object,
as I was very busy at the time, and could not therefore drive
myself. It was very late before she came back; she had kept the
poor boy at the cottage door nearly two hours, and when she
returned to the carriage was so excited that he was in fear and
trembling all the way home. That night his miserable mother lay
hopelessly intoxicated on a sofa when I retired to my
resting-<i>place</i>, for to rest I certainly did not retire.
From that day she utterly broke down, and became lost to all
shame; one appetite, one passion alone, possessed her; a mad
thirst for the drink. We separated by mutual consent, and I made
her an allowance sufficient to supply all her lawful wants. Alas!
Alas! The sad end hurries on. She wrote to me for a larger
allowance; I knew what she wanted it for, and I refused. She
wrote again and I did not reply. Then she wrote to Mary with the
same object. Of course, I need hardly tell you that the children
remained with me. Poor dear Mary loved her mother dearly, and
sent her all her own pocket money. I found it out, and forbade it
for the future. Two more years passed by. From time to time I
heard of my miserable wife; she was sinking lower and lower. At
last, in the twilight of an autumn evening, as Mary was returning
home alone, a wild-looking, ragged woman crept towards her with a
strange, undecided step: it was her mother. She flung herself at
her child&rsquo;s feet, imploring her, if she still had any love
for her, to find her the means of gratifying her insatiable
thirst. She must die, she said, if she refused her. Poor Mary,
poor Mary! Terror-stricken, heart-broken, she spoke words of
love, of entreaty, to that miserable creature; she urged her to
break off her sin; she pointed her to Jesus for strength; she
told her that she dared not supply her regularly with money, as
she had promised me that she would not, and it would do her no
good. The wretched woman slunk away without another word. Next
day her body was found floating on the river; she had destroyed
herself. Poor, dear Mary never looked up after that. She
connected her mother&rsquo;s awful end with her own refusal to
give her money for the drink, though there could be no blame to
her: and so she faded away, my lovely child, and left me, ere
another spring came round, for the land of eternal summers. I was
heart-sick, hopeless; life seemed objectless; I gave way to
despondency, and forgot my duty as a man and a Christian. I felt
that I was no proper guide nor companion for poor John; so I sent
him first to France, where he gained his skill as an artist and
musician; and since then he has, by his own desire, been a
traveller in distant lands. I let my house, and came over to
Hopeworth, to be out of the way of everything and everybody that
could remind me of the past. Yet, I could not forget. You noticed
the vacant space in my sitting-room, where a picture should have
been; that empty space reminded me of what might have been, had
my wife, whose portrait should have been there, been a different
wife to me. But light came at last. When I saw <i>you</i>, Mary
my child, for the first time, I scarce knew what to say or think.
You were, and are, the very image of my own loved and lost one,
my Mary my beloved child; the portrait behind the panel is hers.
I longed to have you for my own. I determined, however, to see
what you were; I went to the juvenile party merely for that end.
And then, when John came home unexpectedly, I resolved in my
heart that, if I could bring it about, you <i>should</i> be my
own dear child. So John and I talked it over; and John, who is a
true branch from the old tree, a little crotchety or so, was
resolved to win you in his own fashion; and, having learnt a
little colonial independence, he wished to look at you a bit
behind the scenes; so he would come before you, not as the heir
of an eccentric old gentleman, with a good estate and plenty of
money to speak for him, but as the travelled artist and
music-master. And now, I think I&rsquo;ve pretty well unravelled
the greater part of the tangle; the rest you can easily smooth
out for yourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see it has been &lsquo;nearly lost, but dearly
won.&rsquo; My child, Mary, you nearly lost old Esau&rsquo;s
heart, when you seemed bent on throwing your own away; but
you&rsquo;ve won it, and won it dearly, like a dear good child.
You nearly lost your peace to one who would soon have drowned it
out of home, but you won it dearly and bravely, I know, at no
little sacrifice. And John, my son, I once thought you&rsquo;d
nearly lost the noblest and best of wives; but you&rsquo;ve won
her, and dearly, too, but she&rsquo;s worth the price of a little
stooping, ay, and of a great deal too. And old Esau Tankardew
nearly lost his peace and his self-respect, in selfish
unsanctified sorrow, but he has won something better than
respect, though it cost him a hard struggle; he has won a
daughter who hates that drink which blotted out light and joy
from the old man&rsquo;s home and heart; and he has won, through
grace, a peace that passeth understanding, and can say,
&lsquo;Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
